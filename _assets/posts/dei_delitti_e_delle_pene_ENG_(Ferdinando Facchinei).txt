lets suppose that someone has written some bloody [Libello] against a prince: that the author of that [Libello] has been seen by two witnesses while he was writing it; and lets suppose that such [Libello] has been delivered to Justice according to the laws of such Justice the author deserves death. Lets imagine that this [reo] is already in custody, (self given), and examined juridically but that has denied everything. The question now is what to do about such [perpetrator] that according to our Laws can't be sentenced because not confessed? One of two:
Either it will be required to release him, despite proven [reo]; either sentence it, despite not confessed; as it is used to do in many countries. Nobody would say the first (answer) ; so we shall say that the supposed [reo] is going to be sentenced to death. Now. If ot this [reo] is going to be given torture and that he is going to resist it; he would avoid certain death; for such [reo] then torture would make some kind of grace as I said above. Again: if torture wouldn't be used in our courts except in such cases then torture couldn't be reprimanded as cruel use.
If then its going to be said that that [reo] has got to be sentenced to death despite not confessed and doing the same for all the convicted (perpetrators) then I will say (louder) that torture is useful; because I suppose that keeping the method of sentencing (perpetrators) not confessed, often it would be taken a chanche to sentence to death more than one innocent; such disorder would happen more rarely if torture would be used more; although I confirm, just and useful the (usage/application) of this torment.
About the torments that are given in the second case; being these very rare, out of the order and always about the safety of the State; as such calling injust, cruel and useless these torments, is the same as calling cruel, useless and injust some executions of magistrates of public health and also those of some medics and some surgeons. The society has the right to free itself from a madman in any way it judges (fitting/faster).
The usage of certain torture for I don't know what kind of blasphemy, despite not practiced anymore as the usage of torture to obtain (accomplices); I confess I feel sorry for those {the customs described above} too. But to oppose and condemn such customs, one should be informed of the reasons and the motives why they have been introduced and that without doubt they {the motives} have been very strong, because one shall not think of cruelty or injustice, against the courts, and [massime] of those of Italy; more so that the second of such customs I know is being practiced in some provinces of Italy itself, the most beneficent and most loving of humanity. I reply here, that it is better that an inhuman assasin already sentenced to death suffers a little bit more than release his accomplices so that they might keep the Society among continuos scares.
I dare to hope now that the strength of all my observations is goind to sound more convincing from my notes that I will make succed here to the apparent reasons brought from [A.] against the claimed cruelty and inutily of torture.
His first reason therefore, is intended as difficulty against the usage of torture in this form: A man can't be called [reo]. before the sentence of the Judge, neither the Society can deprive him public protection, unless it has been established that he has broken the pacts according to which it {the public protection} was given to him: What is then ( continues the [A.]) that right, if not that of the strength that gives the [podesta] to a judge to give a punishment to a citizen, while it is being doubted that he is [reo] or innocent? The [A.] calls this doing a [dilemma], and brings it. It is not new this [dilemma] \(says him\) either the crime is certain or not; if certain it is not required any other punishment except the one established by the law, and useless are the torments, because useless is the confession of the [reo]; if it is not certain, an innocent should not be tormented, becase such {the reo} is a man according to the Laws, of whom crimes are not proven.
Its needed that I confess, that this is a speech and an argument that must seduce people not very knowledgable in such disciplines; but that to say the truth about its meaning, it astounds how a Literate of high penetration and good [criterio] {of high standard, a very good literate} as it appears our [A.] was not ashamed of bringing such a fallacious and miserable reasoning and furthermore how he has had the courage of speaking about a [dilemma] that has been debunked a hundred times and made disappear {the dilemma}.
The deception and the weakness of his speech, must condemn as much as his level, since he has the impertinence of willing to be pedantic in such serious matters, to all the courts and rulers of the universe. 
Let's see if I say the just.

PAGES: 12-15

If there is someone that doubts that it is a paradox, (but thinks true that), a truth can be deduced from the falsehood that directly opposes the very truth, I hope to clarify that here. Lets suppose that the Society has already been formed. What is the end for which men gather themselves in a Society? To put their lives in more security. Optimally. {to live safer}. Imagine now, that one of these members kills another. This is a contradiction of the human heart, to believe guilty of a thousand deaths a murderer; but the murderer never believes himself worthy of death. {never thinks he deserves death}. Therefore the supposed murderer will be sentenced to death, so that the Members {of the society} carry out the end for which they gathered in a Society. Who will be the one that will want to be the cop though? And {who will want to be} minister of execution of Justice? Nobody, because I would be doing wrong to humanty if I said, it could be found, who wants to spontaneously be the executioner {headsman}, or that when he joined the Society, he gave to the same {the society} the right to oblige him to a deed, so infamous, and repulsive, and hated.
Every man is fallible; therefore the murderer could suspect some injustice in his Judges, and without doubt he will suspect that case, and will say that he never had the intention to sacrifice his life, or his own freedom, in the hands of fallible and biased Judges. I don't consider reasonable who here doesn't notice an insurmountable difficulty, to the formation of a Society of men. This is the the judgement of [A.]. Nothing. What kind of Government will choose the supposed associates.{?} Without any doubt the aristocratic {kind}, preferibly in a population which wether by Climate, or other accidents {fortuities}, would be made of men of strength of body, and (Spirit) {Mind} very different between each other. Who will be in such supposition, {the one} who wants to do the wrong to himself of believing himself inferior to others, in matters of domain rights, superiority, or having to be a perpetual subject?
Moreover this Society will either want only one Religion, or it will tolerate all of them. Is it possible that everyone would want to subdue to a single Religion? Im sure that the Author will convene with me: since everyone will convene, that it can't subsist with the passing of time a Society where everybody is free to think as they please in the Matter of Religion. More still. There should be for the [Spiriti Forti] the freedom to philosophize, and to examine if the Government, and the Politics of Society, is good or bad; It will be doubted if the right of the Society, is well founded, or not: if their procedures are (just) {correct}, and their sentences etc; all these however are many difficulties that show the impossibility of the formation, and establishment of a free Society; Hence it is true, that from the supposition that such a Society exists, it is deduced being impossible that it could be formed. {paradox}
Therefore if it has never been had an example of a Society born, as our Author imagines it, and if it is true, that such a Society is apparently impossible that could be formed by men, I conclude the hypothesis of this Author, and of all the Writers his Masters , it is false and absurd, and a true chimera.
Never men have been without Master, never they have been independent; and it is very true that the first Father of a family has been the first King, and the first magistrate, and that the strongest among those, or the sagest has always been I will say so their Emperor.
For natural law, all the men, as youngling are subjects of their Parents, because they have received life from the same, and education; after being adult, they become subjects of those, that lordship over the state where they have been raised, and they have for the same natural law obey, and conform to the laws received in that Society; and who denies these principles, destroys the foundation of all the Societies.
Furthermore I affirm, that if the Laws were simple Pacts, and if all men were free, in the sense that the Author wants, nobody would want to oblige himself to observe the Laws, of neither one Nation of the universe, at best, that according to what [A.] affirms. *the laws are left in abandoment to the discretion of those which interest, is to oppose themselves to the most beneficent laws* and at best still that until there will be men, there will be found some [Democriti] {people like Democritus], e dei...
Finally I leave to others to notice if it is exactly true, and if it can be said as an honest man, that the Laws *never have been anything, mostly, other then the instrument of the passions of some fews*. But which are those ever very few happy Nations *that did not wait anything but that the slow movement of the combinations, and human vicissitudes made succede to the end of evils, a (beginning) towards the good, but that hastened the intermediate steps with good Laws*.

PAGES: 15-17

I mean: two codes are mentioned here made in the north. But (so much worse) {I hope they do much worse} for those cold Nations, if they have (delayed) {wavered/hesitated} so much to form them, and we truthfully have nothing to envy of their Laws, neither of the Justice of their Magistrates: and if those laws are good, they are because they look like those {laws} which we live under from more than a thousand years; otherwise they will be bad, as I am sure they are not even more (energic) {vigorous/strict} of ours {our laws}
I observe at last, that [A.] ends this Article, saying that the Philosopher that deserves the gratitude of men, is the one that had the courage from his dark, and despised *(cabinet) {study} to throw into the multitude the first seeds, fruitless for long, of the useful truths.*
Since however I too unfortunately know with how much contempt, for deplorable blindess of some Writers, are received the reasons taken out of the gospel of [G.C.], I will let to know how big is the big empty blasphemy, that here writes [A.], that only now a fanatic Misanthrope managed to bring to the human kind *the first principles of the useful truths* and I will just note, that here [Gio. Giaccomo Rousseau] rejoyces, already mentioned, of whom although I recognize, and are persuaded by the reputation that he enjoys as Literate man, I protest anyway that one day shall quickly come when we will be ashamed of having (lauded) {praised} with so much enthusiasm his maxims and his principles, and that this {day/moment} will be a very shameful proof of the strangeness way of thinking and judging of our so much praised Century, worth however {the proof} of being made subject of a new comedy of the Philosophers.
Moving on now to the second article of the Book we are examining, I reflect, that after his [A.] {of the book} has praised here *the fruits that are owed to the light of this Century* he says that very few have examined, and fought, *the cruelty of the punishments and the irregularity of the criminal procedures* and bewails *how the too unrestricted course of the bad directed {managed} power has given until now a long and (authorized) {allowed} example of cold atrocity*.
To the first of these two frightfully inexperienced complaints, it could be replied, that there hasn't been a more sifted matter and stirred by men, neither one about which it has been written more, and not by buffoons and pettifogging Philosophers, neither by [Spiriti Forti] (mounted) {risen} to fanaticism, but from the most squared heads in the World, as much as this one from *of Crimes, and Punishments*.
To the second then, I can't contain myself not to say, that it seems to be a not cold but very much hot atrocious boldness, to accuse the Justice of nearly all the present Nations of atrocities; when everything to the contrary could be affirmed, that if Justice has (lacked), it has (failed more in) {leaned more on} indulgence, rather than in rigor; I rather advance more, that if the criminals punished in Europe during the course of these last hundred years, with all the rigor of the Laws, have been 10. Those that have been pusnished with too much clemency against the orderings of the same Laws have been more than 100000. Lets see now where does [A.] derive the origin of Punishments from.
He begins by establishing that *the Laws are the conditions, through which free and isolated men in the glove, united themselves in Society, tired of living in a continuous state of war, and of enjoying a freedom made useless by the uncertainty of keeping it*. He the moves on detailing, how if it would have been found present, that *they sacrificed a part to enjoy the rest with certainty, and transquillity* and then says like a (geometrician) that *the sum of all these portions of freedom sacrificed to the good of everybody, forms the sovereignty of the Nation*.
He riflects then upon this hypothesis that *it wasn't enough to form this (Deposit) {of freedom}, but that it was also necessary to defend it from the private encroachments of every man who always tries to take out the Deposit, not only his own portion, but that of the others too*.
From this reflection he then observes that *they were needed however, some sensible motives, enough to divert the despotic (mind) {nature} of every man, from submerging in the ancient Chaos the Laws of the Society*. By the end of all this so well ordered supposition, he deduces, therefore *these sensible motives, are the punishments established against the infringers of the Laws*, and adds, that he calls {them} *sensible motives* because the experience has [...] to see) that *the multitude does not adopt [...] principles of conduct, except with motives, that immediately hit the senses*; because he affirms that *in the eloquence, neither the rants, nor the most sublime truths have been enough to curb for [...] time the passions excited from the live beatings (of) {[...]} the present objects.


PAGES: 17-21

Lets now notice and reflect still with [...] upon this quite known and imaginary hypothesis, of all those Writers, that, supposed men have been born like mushrooms, or that to give them much grace {divine clemency}, they {the Writers} (put) them {the men} lacking of what we call Law of nature, neither made, nor preserved from the supreme Being, as the Christians believe.
And at first I still denie here again to [A.] that the Laws have ever been *conditions of free men, and isolated* and I challenge him to find me one single example of a Society of men of our Globe, that has formed his Laws as here pretends [A.]
Along with it I affirm that it is all arbitrary, despite quite natural, the Sacrifice that he claims those men have made. I denie him then, frankly speaking, that the Sovereignty of Nations, known to us, has ever been the simple result of the Sum of the portions sacrificed from particular men. I don't want to be stand here deciding, which is the Right of Sovereigns over their peoples, neither how they have achieved it; I will rather affirm, that they have never received it from the Spontaneous, and free will of men; that it is absurd to suppose, could be found a population that has the right to form some Sovereignties, and that if the consensus of a populations would have been necessary to form a sovereignty over all the same People, in such case it never would have been formed, neither any Society, nor any legitimate Sovereignty; and I add here more, that it is a Chimera, that Savage men, and free, how some Philosophers  (somewhat by divine grace) suppose them {the men} to be, have been so Save, and so political, to want to cede the (deposit) {bestowal} of the Laws, and the Soverignty over themselves, to other men their equals, and that they could have, moreover, and wanted, to oblige their children...If the a [Spirito Forte] was susceptible {capable} of an honored sincerity even where its a matter of renouncing their own opinions, I would want here to appeal to them (the same) if they {the strong spirits} believe that it is possible to find just one of of their superb, and singular {rare} race, that wanted to cede the [menoma] {smallest} part of their liberty even into the hands of (nothing less of the most honest Philosopher of the Earth)? How , therefore, (it could ever be possible to) imagine the first men of the world to be so docile, that they would have wanted to spontaneously make such Sacrifice? 
These Lords as long as they (are not obliged to confess), that the Right of Sovereigns, has an origin conforming the true system of the creation of Man, they would be ready, either to supposed all our first progenitors, {to be} many great Philosophers, or to form the most extravagantly horrible systems that degrade humanity even more.
I concur then, that sensible motives were required for compliance to the laws, and that these are indded the Punishments, and (chastisements) {retributions?}; and I claim, that it would be a great boldness, and respectively a terrible blasphemy to affirm that *neither eloquence, nor declamations, and not even the most sublime truths*, that is neither Religion as it is here understood sufficiently, *are enough to curb for so long the passions of men.* I am ashamed, honestly, having to write in this season in Europe, that if the public and sensible punishements were the only ones that had to hold men from commiting evil {wrong doings}, at this time they would have devoured and destroyed each other. These are the truths admitted, and confessed from the most stubborn, and from the most impious thinkers. And we will have a chance to talk about this same matter further on. Lets hold steady {the thought} that according to [A.] neither the natural Law, nor the most sublime truths, nor Religion can withold men from doing wrongs; but only the sensible punishments. Let's move on.
~Pg.7.~ In the second Article he says that no man has made the free gift of part of his own freedom, in view of the good public, which is conceded to him {[A.]}, because it is known that man after a certain state was not (naturally) {according to his nature} capable anymore of much generosity; That, however, that we cannot grant him {[A.]}, because it is arbitrary, it is that which follows, that is that *it was the necessity, that forced men to cede part of their own freedom.* I concede him again, that *everybody doesn't want to put in the public Deposit, but the smallest portion possible, the only one {part} that is enough to induce others to defend them*, but I highly scream {shout loudly}, that it is a ruinous principle, to teach that the aggregate of these minimum possible portions forms the right to punish, becasue it true without (contrast) {doubt}, that Sovereigns don't have to have any other rule to punish, but that of the public utility, that is conforming to the mind of the Supreme Legislator; but it is then ruinous to sustain, that the right that the Sovereigns have to punish, is born from the minimum possible portions, that their subjects give them {to the Sovereigns}.
No number of only minimum possible parts of authority, could ever give a sufficient right {claim}, and power to the Sovereigns to be able to punish the subjects according to their interest and for the end to which men have united themselves in a Society; That in case they grant it {the freedom part}, in such case the Sovereigns would gain more power, in proportion of the higher number that makes up the Populations, and so the Social contract would be ruined, against that, that [A.] would not want.
Moreover, if such a doctrine was admitted, it should be necessary to accord, that as much as the whole, as the parts, could break the Pact (to their whim) {at any whim}: it is certain that everybody would attempt it, everytime it was a matter of punishing them; becasue it is known, that man is capable of (absenting himself) from the Laws and from the most Sacrosant duties, wherever it is the case of exempting himself from some punishment; and all of these would be the minimum part of the disconcerts, that would happen in the Societies, if it would be admitted to be true the said condemned (fantastic) {imaginary} Doctrine. A sovereignty to which every subject is sovereign; a subject, that thinks to have the right to create the Sovereignty, will never form a perfect Society. If the right of the sovereigns is nothing but that, that they receive from the Peoples, it will always be a right {claim} in contradiction, particularly in the case when the number of the faithful associates observant of the pact was balanced with the number of those that wouldn't want to observe {follow/fulfil} it. It would be the same, as to say that man's strength to think is born from his strength to think. And it should be noted another terrible inconvenience. If a man, in the moment he enters a Society, doesn't renounce to the right, that he has above his own life, therefore it stays within him. If it {the right} stays, then he has not lost it, and if he has not lost it, it should be said that since he has the right to defend his own life, even with the death of the one {life} of one of his aggressors, so that, he would have the right to kill even who represents the Society, in the case, that this one would want his life {of the aggressor} to be taken away. Most ruinous opinion.

PAGES: 21-25

From this doctrine [A.] nevertheless deduces four consequences that deserve some observation, although not containing anything new; And I want to jump to page 11 to point out an error, that, I confess, from a Writer of good criterion how Ours {[A.]} shows having in many things, I would not have ever expected. Lets hear it, since it is equally clear, that (again), it is what is (included) in just the first two lines of the Article of the said page. *There isn't a more dangerous thing of that common axiom, that it is necessary to consult the Spirit of the Law*: So, precisely, [A.] that adds this great reason of his, that is that because *this would be a riverbank broken at the torrent of opinions*. To those then, that wouldn't want to believe upon the word, makes say, that *this truth, that seems a paradox to vulgar minds, (battered) more by a small present disorder, than from the deadly, but distant consequences, that are born from a false principle rooted in a Nation, it seems proven to me* and it brings me immediately his demonstration, that it is especially {exactly} this, that because *each man has his point of life, each man in different times has a different one* and that however *the Spirit of the Law, would be the result of a good, or bad Logic of a Judge....and would yet depend from the violence of his passions, from the weakness of who suffers, from the relations of the Judge with the offended, and from all the minimal forces, that cause the appearance of any object, in the (floating) mind of man etc.*
To begin now from this last reason; I argue, that if one would discourse in that manner, not only it should be said that it is dangerous to allow the spirt of the Law to be consulted; but more over that it it no Law should be executed {enforced}; rather it would be better to abolish all of them, and to never make new ones again, so to melt all the contracts of Society; because as much as those that make them, as those that have to enforce them, are all men each one having his own point of life, different from the others, because otherwise, even the creation of the Laws could be suspected, that was the *result of a good, or bad Logic*, and that it depends *from the violence of passions etc.* and this {fact} as much more (since) each generation of men acquires every day greater (lights) {knowledge}, and greater experience, and it believes to have the right to suspect, that the past {generations} have not even been educated, and to pretend however, that Laws made for example in [tempi scolastici] {scholastic times}, must not be approved from the [Spiriti Forti] (Free Thinkers) of our Century. And here is where all the reasonings and the systems of almost all the modern Writers, of some Sects, and mainly that of the Socialists conduct headlong. Lets resume again.
I naively confess, that to my vulgar mind it seems a paradox that of [A.] that it is dangerous *to consult the spirit of the Law*: It is true unfortunately, that the adit {ability} to be able to interpret the Laws can cause some evil; but it is on the other hand very certain, that it would (happen) {be} worse, if the spirit of the Law wasn't consulted and if there wasn't room for interpretation; and the reason is that it will never be found by change a single Law that is clearly conceived, and expressed with such precision, that it could be applied to all the cases and circumstances, without having the need to consult the spirit. It is clear after all, that to enforce a Law, it must be well understood: now, to me, understanding it {the Law} well as much as it is needed to execute it, is the same as consulting his Spirit and interpreting it. Therefore there will always be to fear, that a bad Logic, and that the violence of passions, prevented to (straightly) understand it, and to execute it well. In short it seems to me that it is the same paradox, to say that it is dangerous to consult the Spirit of the Laws simply because there is some danger of not guessing it perfectly, as to affirm that one only and unique dress can serve {fit} well to all the men of any age, height, sex, condition, and in any time they may live in.
After all it is an unworthy insult, that is made to all the Magistrates, to suppose all of them capable of willing to do cruel interpretations, against their peers, especially where it is a matter of loss, either of their life, or of their honor. But fear not, [A.], that the Magistrates would interpret the Laws to the detriment of the miserables where it is a matter of criminal judgments, that unfortunately they show to be lenient in such cases, or at least they are forced to show themselves as such, to the Parents, Friends, (Protectors) that criminals never lack. Moreover he can't think and write of Justice in that manner, who finds himself in the false supposition that Justice draws his origin, neither from the Eternal Legislator, that everything sees, and that everything forecasts, nor from the lights (etched) from the same {the Eternal Legislator?} in the hearts of men, but from the only *minimal possible portions of freedom spontaneously ceded from men etc...*. He did right though [A.] to close his reasoning upon this matter, with these words, or rather, with this very insolent irony, to not think not even against an [Ezzelino], that is that: *everything should fear, if the spirit of tiranny was compatible with the spirit of reading* 

PAGES: 25-28

~Page 2.~ [A.] says that another prejudice of the Laws is *the obscurity* of the same {laws}; and claims that the evil: *will be very big if the Laws are written in a tongue foreign to the People*: however he would wish, that there was a Code of the criminal Laws written in the language of every Nation; asserting that: *The greater the number of those that will (understand) and will have in their hands the sacred code of the Laws, the less frequent will be the crimes*. Despite I am not going to denie that the obscurity of the Laws is a great evil, and that it would be desirable not only that there was a Code of the Laws, written in the tongue of every Nation, but moreover that they {the laws} would be written on all the walls and all the cantons of the Cities, affirm anyway that the grievances that [A.] makes here are ridicolously superfluous.
If I didn't know (by practice) how much disgust is {cause}{blamed} to some (form/kind) of Writers, the examples plucked from the History of the Jews exactly because it is divine, I would oppose here to the ideas of [A.] the example of those People, that despite had a Code, very declared {crystal clear} laws written in their tongue, and despite they read them continuosly, even better they wore them tied on the arms and on the forehead, and that they believed them {the laws} a stupendous Opera of their supreme Legislator, lived at any rate among continuous very wicked transgressions. As he shows to be so much versed in the Legal history of other Nations, I beg him to remember what has been the exactness, and the puntuality by which they have observed, and executed their Laws, the Greeks and the Romans, that surely they didn't have Laws written in a language, that they couldn't understand. I beg him more to reflect, that the criminal Laws are known to everybody, and in a language indelibly natural. Everybody knows, what implies killing a man, kidnapping the next one {a stranger} etc. The Mad {people} then, as they don't know how to and don't want to live honestly, as for the ordinary {commonly} they neither know how to read. Most modern Nations, have their Laws written in the idiom of the Country, and everywhere, like among us, the criminal Laws are know at least by living tradition; and nevertheless they transgress them, maybe even more, that they won't do {infringe} those {laws}, that they preserve written in some dead language. (Can I) here now venture into and pit yet another paradox? A Code of Laws made common in every sense, would make men more cautious in committing evil; but it {the clear code} would make {the men} more daring in commiting it {the evil}, and would not reduce, rather multiply the crimes.
With all that [A.] shows himself so much persuaded about the good effect that a Code of Laws made common to everybody would produce, that believes to be able to deduce \(I don't know how much naturally, neither to what opportunity {end} \) the following consequence. ~Pag. 14 a.2~ *A consequence* \(says him\) *of these last reflections is that without the Writing, a Society will never take a fixed form of Government, where the strength is an effect of the whole, and not of the parts*. And shortly below he reflects that *From this we see how much it is useful, the press, that makes the Public, and not some few, depositary of the Holy Laws, and how much it has dissipated that (somber) Spirit of (cabal) and intrigue, that disappears in face of the lumens, and of the Sciences apparently despised, and really feared from him {the spirit}* : After that with a scary frankness he goes wild in a furious way against the past Centuries, against the Princes, the ecclesiastical people, and Religion. * This is the cause *, \(he shouts\) * why we see diminished in Europe the atrocity of crimes, that made moan {sough} our Fathers, who each other became tyrants, and slaves: * and continues saying : * Who knows the history of two or three centuries ago, and our {history} will be able to see, how from the (bosom) of Luxury, and of the Softness {Weakness} were born the sweetest virtues, the Humanity, The Charity, the Tolerance of human errors : will see which were the effects of that, that I would call (wrongly?) {or to make a wrong} ancient simplicity, and good faith, the humanity groaninig under the implacable superstition, the avarice, the ambition of few, dye of human blood the gold chests, and the thrones of Kings, the occulted treacheries, the public massacres, every noble, tyrant of the Plebs, the ministers of the Evangelical truth soiling with blood the hands that everyday touched the God of Meekness, are not the doing of this enlightened Century that some call corrupted*.
I, despite it is repeated, that comparisons are always hated, will ask in this place: first: if all this invective has been put here conveniently nad usefully? Second: If, rather, couldn't it be of bad consequences as much as for [A.] as for others? Third: if it is backed by the truth? Uselessly, tautly, dangerously, slanderously. Now.

PAGES: 28-31

It is false, that the press has dissipated the somber Spirit of cabal and intrigue, and the whole World grieves the opposite, and it is natural for it to be this way; in the first place because the (evil knowledge) {cognition of the wrongs} has grown, and human nature is the same; then because the press, together with the good lumens, has multiplied the means to be able to abuse it; so much so that presently many big books are printed, and only the small ones are read, and it can be said that if now the Sciences have grown on the surface, they have receded much more in {their, the sciences} depths. It is a slander, {saying} that the body of Judges and Legislators, \(as it must be inteded here, (rather then) the Government of the states \) apparently despises the Sciences, and that fears them in reality, because if it {the body of...} feared and despised them, they wouldn't have been the first to promote them, with the will to have everything that belongs to their Science and minister printed, up to the most useless minutenesses; and it {the body} wouldn't be composed of, neither would have given to the Literate World so many learned men, and Scientists, as many as we know. Everyone is familiar with *the History of two or three Centuries ago, and ours*, knows and sees that in the Century with live in, vices and crimes have (rather) changed name, but that are the same in number, and in substance, of those of the past three Centuries; at the time, moreover, they {the crimes} were commited with greater courage, and now they are commited with greater cowardice and disguise: so that at that time wrongs were done, but they were confessed as such; and presently there is the impudence to do even bigger wrongs than {what was} once {being done}, and to sustain that the bad is good and the good is bad: so that according to the contrary the good that was done then, resembled their way of dressing and manufacturing, and that now (it has all the analogy with our way of dressing and manufacturing); that back then the Servants were called slaves, but they were in small numbers and were treated as men, but now they are called (maids and butlers), are many, but are treated as {very} worthless beasts; that the weddings were in greater number, and abundant of (yesses) {[siglivolanza] as in "si lo voglio"]}, and that conforming to now he has playfully written one of the most brilliant (wits) {tricks} of our century, it could be said that can't be found but one single wedding, and this {wedding} is much sterile; that the impious back then were called Eretics, and were punished as such; but that the impious of our days are called Free Thinkers...
If it is although true that the happiness of a Country, should be gathered from the majority of its population, and not from any other thing, and if it is equally true, as everyone now pretends {expects}, that the number of men is at the present lower than that of three Centuries ago; therefore the current Century, will be less happy than the pasts {centuries}; besides, for me saying one Century is less happy than another is the same as saying that a Century is stuffed more than the other with vices, crimes, and injustices.
Moreover: who knows the History of the past three Centuries, and that of the last sixty-forty years, should be ashamed of comparing them; because we have heard more atrocities, and more horrible committed attacks, and spilled more blood since {when} we live than what has followed fate , together in all those three Centuries. I know how the current Century (bestows upon us) the iniquities and weaknesses that disgrace it; but one should not be deceived from the appearances; one should judge the customs of our ancestors and of those living from {based upon} the monstrous doctrines contained in the Books of one and the other.
Being so however you want of this obnoxious and difficult comparison, I say, that it must provoke horror to the most daring, seeing written and printed that *from the bosom of luxury, and from the weakness would have been born the sweetest virtues, the Humanity, the Charity, the Tolerance of human errors*. I surely don't know how to comprehend how come a man of letters like [A.] that has sacrificed to the maxims of politics everything that is most precious among us puts in such high regard virtues as equivocal {wrong,confused,unclear,false} as the mentioned ones. Neither it shall be believed that I would write so because it could be the first time that I had read and had heard alike propositions or because I would be among those that *nevertheless groan under the implacable superstition*: I speak this way because I know, and recognize, that that is a equally scandalous and false proposition; and I prove it.
That that is said of a weak man, and lover of luxury, must be said even for a whole Nation, because so shows us experience. A strong man, valiant and a warrior shall be even more sincere, more generous and friendlier than a shy, sensitive and effeminate man; so, even a Nation, powerful, valiant and warlike. Love has its own leisures, and always joins pleasures with laziness and many small desires, but uneasy, because it takes too much to satisfy a man born for the pleasures: therefore to satisfy according the nature of the weak people, that is comfortable, one should have to accomodate the others, and from here the rudeness, the ingratitude, the fakeness.
So, a weak Reign and full of luxury, will be vicious, busy between small things, weak, close to a whole inertia {complete inertness}, although even {close} to his ruin.

One of the most stable principles of the vague and transcendent philosophy of that (kind) of scholars that I don't know by which influence they are called [Spiriti Forti], is that to believe on one hand that all human kind is healthy, good, perfect and not at all needy to be ininitely happy but a little freedom to think {he only needs such freedom to be happy}; and on the other hand to suppose it {human kind} to be stupid, blind, slave, and inferior to the vilest bugs. This principle that has (rampant day thinkers) {people whose profession is to think}, suggests the idea either to boldy exclude whenever they want,  everything that the straight reason, the sound politcs and the true Religion judge necessary, and teach for the good regulation of human kind, either to be able to invent and spread new opinions and new Systems to mount to their whim {accomodating according to their moods} the human nature; this principle I say, has been the one that has strengthened in the last years from the most deep darkness the many horrible monstrous Deeds that the alleged [Spiriti Forti] have given us; But the Book that more than any other \(because more earnestly\) has made abuse of that contradictory ruinous principle, is the one titled [dei Diliti, e delle Pene] come to light through press, but blind, so that I for simple honored love of the beautiful Truth here I understake the examination.
~Judgment of the book~ This small Book, is in any rate one of the most beatutiful pieces troubled {come from a lot of labour} from our Italians on such matters, in our current really happy, and really unhappy Century, and I find it written on the (tone which many works of our days that cause more clamor are made of), because of their revolting hateful novelty, of which it also has all the venom, except that there is [sparlo] {chatter} with more honored dexterity, and with more imposing, more noble, and (sincerity without suspicion). The [A.] says to have written for the fews, I write for everyone; He has made use of, I will call it, imaginary coin; There is need for me to make use of cash, broken and known by everybody.
~End of those notes~ I pone my self to (note/annotate) this [Operetta], so much more willingly, as it seems a true daughter, I will say so, of the [Contratto Sociale di Rousseau], and as much still his reading has confirmed me in my following prejudices.
I. That men of great talent are in the scientific world, that that the men of great wealth are in the political world.
II. That it happens by somekind of mistery, and for an incomprehensible providence, that all the most versed and erudite men, but lacking of religion, fall in a thousand contradictions when writing about some matters.
III. That bad habits give birth to bad books than the other way around { bad books give birth to bad habits}
IV. That presently the worst things are called good, as long as they have in themselves {even} just one good part that favors liberty and libertinage, and bad the best if in those {things} there is a small portion of (wrong), that shocks the (dissolute) passions of men.
V. That despite this has been the Century where it has been kept in great regard and has been made the most use of experience and demonstration {scientific method?}; in any way the most chimeric facts, the most foolish lies, and the doctrines most divergent from the truth, have been believed to be true more than in any other Century.
VI. And that although certain spieces of scholars want to see the evidence as the most indistiputable {thing} that binds men, (propose) in any way the most palpable falsehoods, and with the most terrible bluntness, when they claim something favors {further proves} our prejudices.
Of the remaining, to keep a method in these notes of mine, without any misunderstanding and at the same time naturally, I will follow the Author of this Book, article by article wherever I will want, and nothing I will dare to note, without quoting the author's words beforhand.
If the men of science of the eightneen Century were that much universally well biased towards virtue, and according to such reason they are unfortunately for all the things that have only the shadow and the simple name of liberty and novelty, I would dare to flatter myself, that this (common) work of mine would make some very advantageuos {beneficial} reflections, as many as they are the bad incidences, that I know has occasioned {has run into} at this time the Book [dei Delitti, e delle Pene]. But it comforts me that if I won't enjoy such pleasure, neither I will have to suffer the annoying regrets from which the Author of this Book will always be disturbed. Hence I begin calmly my Notes, and my Reflections.
~Notes about the introduction of the book~ Our [A.] introduces at once by saying to infamy and (detestation) of the most respectable portion of human kind that *men mostly leave in abandonment the most important regulations, to the daily prudence, and to the discretion of those, the interst of which it is to oppose themselves to the most (catere) Laws.*
It should be noted here on the first entrance the seditious (mind/nature), and the bold bluntness whereby [A.] treats human kind as stolid {foolish}, almost like (it wouldn't cost) from all the stories, that in all the times and in all the Centuries, it has been (large/great) the study of the Laws, and always made by the greatest men of the Universe; so that the human condition could be mourned, if it hasn't been able to (form/teach) and execute (in a better way),  the many beautiful and most wise Laws, that we have; but (it should never be said) of men to be guilty of not pursueing the intent.
But it should be reflected more {upon the fact}, that even if it were true, that the laws are left to the discretion of those that have most interest to oppose the same; at any rate it will seem to everyone a dangerous imprudence, to write such things for the Public; maxims that it could be honestly, and with the benefit of the Nation, present secretely the supposed disorders to the persons, that can bring remedy, which, whatever the vexed imagination of [A.] have never been lacking.
It should be reflected that, being the Laws many metaphorical chains, so that, since it would be cruelty to a man to leave the feet chained with the same chain from when he was still young after he has grown, likewise it would be an injustice wanting all Laws to be immutable and not ruled by the daily (prudence/caution).
~About the Social contract~

PAGES: 31-34

A weak man is always closer than a sober {temperate,reasonable man} to stupidity, and from this indiscretion is born; hence they say that that the slaves in Africa are of better condition {quality} than the servants of the delicate, and lover of pleasures, people in Europe.
The Nations, and the weakest and most given {dedicated} to pleasures  Centuries, have indeed been the most vicious and tyrannical. The principal cause of the decadence and the ruin of the greatest empires has always been the weakness {softness}: after all, an Empire will never fall if it is really filled with virtuos examples.
Besides, I have heard quite many encomiums {accolades} about Luxury, and I confess having heard them even from a lot of people, neither less sage, nor less learned; but I also confess with equal sincerity, not having found even one {man}, that had the right, and distinct idea about what Luxury is. More than twenty Authors that I have consulted on this matter, couldn't satify me, and they seemed to me almost all in agreement about the substance, and conflicting only with words, and almost all misled into judging its consequences. I don't flatter myself being capable of better reasoning than the others; I only hope to be able to better assign the ways through which it could be decided with better precision and certainty if the Luxury is useful or not? I quickly forewarn that my opinion is that, since, Luxury can only be useful in one way to a private {individual}, that is when he travails the matter which the same Luxury attends to, with less fatigue, and damage, than what he would suffer {endure} if he dealt with another kind of Operations, it should be said the same about the Luxury of a Reign. I will be (small) {short, quick}; but I trust that the utility will compensate the bore.
I. The word Luxury excites in me these three ideas. 1. The idea of those things, that are called, *rich, good* and *beautiful*, which are made use of building, and adoring our Houses, preparing and serving our tables and for our clothing. 2. The idea of the use, that make, men of every condition, in diverse circumstances and times, of the said rich, good, and beautiful things. 3. The idea of the mind, of the intention, and of the end for which men use the same said things, rich, good and beautiful.
II. The said things, rich, good , and beautiful, since every other thing and every other matter of the world are to mankind either *necessary* for their preservation, either *abundant*, or *superfluous*, that is either they serve to those things necessary to live, either to have them in abundance, or to posses them in superfluity.
What would they be the *necessary, abundant and superfluous* things, to mankind, I don't dare to define; but for now I yet intend these three terms, and I give to the same {terms} the sense that is commonly given to them by everybody. It shall only be noted that the things, for use by man, can be called, abundant, and superfluous, not just as their quantity and their number; but even as the use we make of them; and even as the need that we have of the same be it simply for our pleasures, or for the indispensable needs for our preservation and better being. This distinction is important to have a right idea of the Luxury, and to be able to form a straight {correct} judgement.
III. The *ends*, and the *motives* for which men make use of the things, either *necessary*, either *abundant*, or *superfluous*, can be good, or bad, like all the others. I, however, have no intention to talk here neither of these ends nor of these motives, as matter that belongs {pertains} to Moralists.
IV. It is clear now from what I have premised, that some things, that to a man are just necessary, to another could be abundant, or even superfluous; as for example a Magistrate will have necessity, for his (rank), and to stay {conform} to the customs of his Country, of four clothes {suits}, or of four Horses, which for a private of mediocre {ordinary} condition would be abundant and for a simple private, would be superfluous, because he can preserve his body healthy, without needed to keep Horses.
Therefore *necessary thing, abundant thing, and superfluous thing*; are all relative things, that is that they have relation with the different ages, sex, state, rank, condition, and other circumstances, in which men found themselves; and that, however, can be called *necessary, abundant, and superfluous* according to the different, ages, sex, state and condition of each man.
Here I am now to my point. Being the idea of Luxury, made of many different ideas, of rich rhings, of good things, of beautiful things; of the idea of the good use, and the bad, of those {ideas} of the necessary, abundant, superfluous things, and even of the ideas of relation to people of different age, state, condition, etc. being, I say, this idea composed by many different ideas, of things that can be, either morally, or politically good, or bad, therefore we should not be surprised, if the opinions, and the judgements of men around Luxury, are so much different and contrary.

PAGES: 34-37

Men judge some things, according to how each one conceives them and in which manner each one finds himself disposed and closer to the habit of association made by his ideas, more with that than another idea; so there is that, while judging if the Luxury is useful or not, happens that to to someone some ideas are associated rather than other ones of which the idea of Luxury is made of; therefore since Luxury contains many ideas of good and bad things; so it will happen that there will be good and bad judgements of itself {Luxury}. Therefore, if it is yearned to judge correctly, it is convenient to develop all those ideas at first, put them in a certain order, examine them, one by one, and then form our judgement.
Now, as for me 1. I approve everything that is good, rich and good, and I desire that all the men would be abundant to superfluity of all this things; and in this sense I am an approver and defender of Luxury. 2. The will to use and help oneself of the rich, good and beautiful things, when there is a lack of the necessary {things}, I disapprove and condemn it; Because reason wants that necessary things should be thought to at first, because they are useful; and then to the abundant and superfluous {things}, withouth which it is possible to live healthily. Doing the opposite is what I call harmful Luxury, hence it is condemned by me. 3. To work with each one own hands the things that serve necessity, and that make up abundancy, and superfluity of the things rich, good and beautiful, this, I say that will be a good thing, in proportion to the gain that will be made with the different sorts of our labors. 4. To desire, however, and make use of the things that make up abundancy or superfluity of the things of men, when there is lacking of the necessary ones and even looking for the superfluous ones, when we don't even have the abundant ones, I condemn all of this, and I call it insane Luxury and destructive as much for a private {individual}, as for the state.
The first Theorem that I want to establish now, is that so: Albeit being true that all the rich and beautiful things might serve as a matter for Luxury, \(despite not all the uses of any one of these matters being Luxury\), anyway, very few are the men that have the superfluous, few those that have the abundant, and all the rest of the men finds himself confined {limited} by the pure possession of the only things of indispensable necessity.
Second Theorem. I (suppose) {postulate} that in all the Nations, and in al lthe Populations of the World, the number of those who lack the necessary things, is equal to the those that posses the superfluous ones.
Third Theorem. striving to multiply superfluous things in the Societies, is the same as looking for the way to divide smaller and smaller parts of the necessary things, namely miserables.
Fourth Theorem: To travail for each own use the superfluous things that are not needed neither for being lifted up from necessity, nor for becoming rich, but for the sole pleasures; I say this (labor) {trouble} is such to weaken the Nations, and makes their {nations} Body, and their Spirit lazy, and inept to procure and provide the necessary and abundant things.
Consequence: If it is true that it is bad politics to look for superfluous things when there is lack of the necessary ones, if it is certain that the labor {use,purpose} of things that only serve pure pleasure, that make up the true Luxury, unnerves the body and the spirit, and if it is also true that the usage of the things servants of the Luxury of the pleasures, produces the same bad effect, as much into privates, as into the Public, Luxury then, will be a bad thing, even more, it being able to give birth to the *sweet virtues of Humankind and Charity* won't bear anything but the duplicity, cunningness, indiscretion and cruelty; because a man that has so little judgement to deprive himself of the necessary food for his own sustenance, for the mad vanity of wearing a brilliant of price {expensive brilliant} on a finger, such man I say, I consider capable of any insanity, indiscretion and cruelty; (while) {when} (someone) is indiscreet and cruel with himself, much more he will be able to be so with others.
In fact, isn't that excess of boldness with which our [A.] insults *the ancient simplicity*, mourns *the moaning mankind under the implacable superstition, and the avarice, and the ambition of those that have stained with human blood [...] and the Thrones of Kings, with which [...], and the public massacres, with which he blasphemes against the Ministers of the Evangelic Truth, calling, *their hands filthy with human blood*, with which, lastly, it is seen written all this book of his, isn't it not an effect of these *sweet virtues*? Others will avenge the boldeness of this Writer, and it is enough for me here to have simply recognized it.

PAGES: 37-39

~(a) Pag.19 Art. 2.~ I have said since the beginning of these *Notes* of mine that the Book that we examine is one of the most beautiful pieces that have been written in these recent years, and that conseuquently his Author must be a man of talent and very (scienced) {expert in sciences}; I have said it, and I don't recant myself; but I have to confess, that while I was reading back one of his propositions, that I will report below, I almost regretted having formed such judgement {opinion} of the same {author}, so much it {the proposition} transcends, and it is opposed to Religion and common sense. I wanted to read it back more than once, I have examined it, I have suspended judgement, and I have even questioned if there were printing errors, but I have equally found it as perverted as clear, and appropriate {typical} to who has written it, such as ~Of the measure of Punishments~ *(a) The only true measure of crimes, is the damage done to the Nation, although err those who believed, true measure of crimes, the intention of who commits them.* I shiver for the Author of this proposition, and I reckon entirely superfluous being here to answer and to point out his absurdity and his monstruosity. I will only say that it tends fo lift every remorse of conscience, not only, even all the duties of Nature and Religion. Who ever ignored that the Sovereigns don't have to calculate the measure of punishements, with the amount of wrongs done to the Society? But true crime is not given without malice, otherwise even houses in ruins, fires, floods, rocks, the fire and the whater should be punished. What a moral worthy of a Spartan and of a Free Thinker of our days!
~Other error in the measure of Punishments. Pag. 20 Art. 3.~ And here is another doctrine, in some regards even worse than the first: *Other measure the crimes* (says him *(b)*) *with the dignity  of the offended person, without considering the importance regarding the public good*, and he immediately adds this sacrilegious sophistry *if this was the true measure of crimes, an irreverence to the Being of Beings should be punished more atrociously than the murder of a Monarch, being the superiority of nature an infinite compensation to the difference of the Offended.
Here I can't contain myself, not saying that it is either a ham-fisted supposition, or a mischievous calumny, affirming as [A.] does, that there have ever been those that have measured the punishment of the crimes committed against the dignity of the persons, without regard to the damage that similar crimes bring to the public good. Where has [A.] ever read that the crimes commited against the persons constituted in some Dignity, are punished only regarding the dignity of the same, and not yet regarding the good of the Nation? How? Would he teach by adventure that it should be equally reprehended who slapped a vile porter, and who made the same attempt against an Army General?
About the sophism it is true, that the irreverence to the Being of Beings, is a grave sin, and that it will be punished, about the murder of a Monarch, considered simply as a man, and not as a person that represents the most alive images of God on our Globe. And it is another thing saying that a crime is infinitely more serious by his nature than another crime, and another to decide of the way and time by which criminals must be punished. Morover, It should be reflected upon that since we measure the punishment dued to the crimes, with the offense that these make to the Monarch of the Monarchs, or directly against his Divinity, or against the persons that represent him more here on Earth, and that he wants, however, them to be more respected, so that aren't found any inconvenients punishing more the murder of a Monarch of the Earth than an irreverence against the Monarch of the Heaven, because as any offense is always meant to be made against the same God, as any punishment is given for his only regard, so that it is always the Divinity that is (avenged) {vindicated}.
And here it is, how the rules of the Justice founded on the basis of the Theology of the Gospel, are more coherent of the maxims of the Politic of the moderns Writers; Although I affirm that is more secure, more just, and easier, to recover {discover} the measure of the Punishments with the rule of the offsense of {to} the Creator, as Christians understand and explain it, than with the measure of the *damage done to the Nation*, as our Politic teaches; and I support moreover, that this measure is uncertain as all the other humane judgements are, and subject to a thosand contrasts and innumerable controversies.

PAGES: 39-42

~About other allged errors in the measure of the same Punishments~ It should be now believed that couldn't be said more errors on this subject than the ones written by [A.] as now we come to notice. And even the hate that this Writer has against the doctrines of Christianity has made him write new ones; as I will report now. *Finally some thought* \(says with much equivocation \(c\) * that the gravity of the sin, was the measure of the crimes*. Here He calls fallacious this opinion and writes so: *The only necessity has given birth from the (shock) {collision} of passions, and from the (opposition) {clash} of interests, the idea of the Common utility, that is the base of human Justice. He calls these relationships between men and men, and relationships of equality; the relationships, then, from men to God, he says, are *relationships of dependence from a perfect being, and creator, that has reserved to only himself the right to be Legislator, and judge at the same time, because only he can can be it without inconvenience* : then he continues, * If he has established external punishments to those who disobey his omnipotence, whoever might be the bug {small man}, that will dare replace the divine, that will want to avenge the Being, that is enough for himself, that can't receive any impression {sensation} of pleasure or pain from objects etc.?* And concludes coherently, that *the gravity of the sin depends from the inscrutable malice of the heart*, although that *this can't be known from finite beings without knowing {its} revelation*. After such conclusion he broaches and questions *how then, it will be taken as the rule to punish the Crimes? In this case, men could punish* (says him) *when God himself forgives, and forgive when God himself punishes.
I haven't here copied the written propositions to refute them: this couldn't be done except with weapons of tempering that don't deal a great blow against some iron chests; moreover a volume {big book} would be needed: it should therefore suffice that I have touched on those that show that [A.] has the misfortune of being a false Christian, a true epicurean, and a Free Thinker; and I will say just one word upon his definition that: *the gravity of the sin depends from the inscrutable malice of the heart*. This Definition seems rather contradictory, to the other already reported, where he affirms of being an error that: *the measure of the crimes should be the intention of who commits them*: because in this regard, *the intention to sin*, and the malice of the hearth, are the same thing, and both can, and have to serve the measure of the Punishments; despite [A.] denies it. Besides, the malice of the human heart is not at all an inscrutable mistery, because despite the cause is ignored, and the force of the same, it can be calculated anyway from the effects, in a manner as certain as it would be an (affectation), if I wanted to talk about it here, being very much well known.
 ~\(a\) Pag.2~ However he doesn't contradicts himself in what he writes in the Article that immediately follows \(a\), because here he repeats very clearly, that: *the true measure of the Crimes, is the damage {to} (of) the Society*: he wants that this should be a *palpable truth*; and nonetheless: *through a marvelous combination of circumstances, not known with decisive certainity except by some few thinkers, men of every Nation and every time*: therefore he laments with incredible blindness and audacity that: *The (Asiatic) opinions* \(namely the Religion\) *and the passions* namely the Christian Principles \(*clothed with authority and power, have most of the times, for insensible pressures \) preaching of the truths of the Holy Gospel *some times for violent impressions \(the miracles, the most sensational ones\) *On the timid credulity of the men* \(the Christian People\) *dissipated the simple notions that maybe formed the first Philosophy of the emerging Societies, and to which the light of this century,* \(the light was in the world, but the darkness etc. \) *it appears, that it leads us back, although with that greater firmness {steadiness}, that can be administered by a Geometric exam, from a thousand baneful consequences, and from the same obstacles.*

PAGES: 42-44

Who would be (here) that Christian so little zealous of the reputation of his divine Religion that could contain himself, in this passage, from not bursting in the most tremendous execrations against the infamous and empty slander, by which it is described and calumniated everything that goes as most noble and respectable in the universe? Who could ever refrain himself from exclaiming that this Author has surpassed the (measure) of the most malignant and unrestrained satire? As for me, anyway, I want to show that I know what should be the moderation that everyone who writes against another one should insist upon, even though I have never approved the misplaced delicacy of all those who condemn of impoliteness all the Literates that ill-treat certain impious Writers, with not very civil sentences, without, afterwards, formalizing themselves in hearing and in reading, that those with the loutest ways and the most reckless, treat Ecclesiastics as buffoons, Monarchs as Tyrants, Saints as fanatics, Religion as imposture, and that even blaspheme the Majesty of their Creator. Therefore I astain myself from answering that speech, according to who it should deserve, and move on to observe that where {he} ~Pag. 22. Att. 2~ distinguishes the Crimes, he affirms that the crimes of lese Majesty or only the ones that *immediately destroy the Society, and who represents it~: and that a few lines after that he pretends that: *only the tiranny and the ignorance that confuses the terms and the most clear ideas, can give this name, and by consequence the maximum punishments to crimes of different nature, and make so men, in many other occasions, victims of word.*
The reader will have noticed already that the Author, here, speaks of the perfidious crime of heresy, that he arrogantly denies that it could be called crime of lese Divine Majesty and that he treats as tyrants and ignorants, those who teach the contrary, affirming moreover with iniquituous impertinence that the Heretics condemned by the Church and from the Princes are: *victims of word*. I note here, just passing through, how [A.] in page 23 and exactly in the first two lines, says full of spite, after having put beforehand that: *the moral actions, like the physical ones, have their own limited sphere of activity, and are restricted like all the movements of nature, from time and space*: he concludes this way: *although the only captious interpretation, that is ordinarily the philosophy of slavery, can confuse, that which was distinguished with immutable relations from the eternal truth*. [A.] mourns here our Theologians because they tech that a sin is an infinitely large offsense that is commited against the divine Majesty of God; It is not this, however, what I want that shall be noted, but rather the incostant incredulity of our [A.] who at page 18 of his Book, affirms haughtily that: *anyone who reads with Philosophic eye the codes of Nations, will find almost always the names of vice and virtue, of good citizen and of guilty, change themselves with the (revolution) of centuries according to the passions and the errors that subsequently agitated the different legislators*. How come combine such argument with his superior words: *Only the Philosophy of slavery can confuse that which was distinguished with immutable relations from the eternal truth* ?
I beg now to carefully note what follows. An impiety, an Heresy, a blasphemy against the omnipotent God himself, according to [A.] wouldn't be nothing but a *word*. And doesn't [A.] teach that those that: *immediately destroy the Society* are true crimes of lese Majesty? Therefore I ask now, if it was going to happen that some of those simple *little words* would become immediate cause of the ruin and destruction of a Society, just that *tiny word* should it be judged, and *punished with the maximum punishment* as a true crime of lese majesty? And how many of these *words* have been the ruin not of one, but of many Societies and Kingdoms? The answer to this question would bring me too far, and would oblige me to remember pointlessly things too (bleak) and (gloomy) {[tetre e funeste]} to which I am adverse as much as I am happy that it is here terminated the first general and fundamental Part of the *Book of Crime and Punishment*, that we have examined up to this point, which Part, on behalf of those principles that are in there established, it is as scabrous as annoying. Lets enter now to examine the second {part}, that we will find without doubt much more interesting than the first: therefore...

PAGES: 44-47

~Introduction to the second part of the notes~ The second part of the Book of [N. Anonimo] is fully (employed) {versed} talking about the Punishments in particular. This is that part of the opera in which [A.] treats that matters, that can be said to be the principal, and true object, and purpose for which he wanted to make this Book. It can be said moreover, that the first part has been written only to give more color to the second; that is the theoretical part, this is the practical one: All the false principles , all the errors, and all the paradoxes, that we have observed in that one, have been thrown for pure erudition, for simple preparation, for oddness and only to give us a taste of his profession by faith of Free Thinker. In this {part}, hovewer, he writes evil by deliberate commitment; It is seen here, that there errors are those of his mind, his heart, his mind, and I will also say of his temperament and of his passions, although all consequences of a system long and stubbornly meditated and loved.
All the material that is treated in this second Part, is that one that is contained, and divided in the Answers, that are given to these Questions, which according to the Author are simple Problems, conceived and expressed by himself as follows \(a\).~\(a\) Pag.30 Art.1~ *Death, is it a punishment truly useful and necessary for the safety and good order of Society? Torture, and torments, are they just, and do they obtain the end that is proposed by the Laws? What is the best way to prevent crimes? Are the punishments themselves equally useful in all (times) {ages}? What influence do they have over customs?*
We will see that the way through which [A.] attempts to solve those Problems, is in all his parts analogous to the principles supposed to be unbreakable by him: he doesn't skimp on neither sophisms nor cavils, nor paralogisms in order to succede.
~\(b\) Pag.??~ Despite himself premising and declaring \(b\) that *these Problems deserve to be broken up with that geometric precision to which the fog of sophisms, the seductive eloquence, and the the shy doubt can't resist*: and to this protest he quickly adds, with rare modesty, that *if it didn't have other merit but the one of having been the first to have presented to Italy, with better evidence, that which many other Nations have dared to write and to start to practice, he would find himself fortunate. So, The Author.
I will put beforehand, still, only two observations, and then I will do my duty.
~Observations on the difference of the incredulous from the men of Religion~ First. I have always observed that among the Incredulous practiced {frequented} by me, or known from their Writings, and among the men heated by the true Religion, slips by this difference, that the Incredulous are sanguinary enemies of the rigor of the Laws, and the healthy Moral, and at the same time cruel despisers and transgressors of the most Sacred duties of Society, and that men of true Religion are passionate supporters of justice, and of the rigor of Laws; but at the same time honest, and decent with all their peers. The former, lovers of their own freedom, even with prejudice of the one {freedom} of others, the latter modest, and resigned even where it comes to the loss of their rights. Those {the Inc.} would like to see themselves set free and favored by Society, and that all others would serve their passions and their inclinations. These {the Rel.} suffer their own burdens with less regret than those of their next ones {neighbors}.
This difference, then, between the men of massive Religion and the Incredulous, is so constant, that I still ensure with much certainty, just from the Reading of the Writings of both, that one Writing is of the incredulous and the other of the religious, considering with how much frankness it can be asserted that one that despises and transgresses the Laws is a Libertine, and that that respects those, and that practices those, is an honest man, and of good religion; because I know that the hate towards the rigor of Laws, is born in the incredulous from a heart arrogantly shy, and inconstant, and from a damaged Spirit, dispersed, and (aflame) {sore}; In the religious man, then, the respect and the love of the Laws themselves, comes from a well made mind, from a straight and innocent conscience: The Incredulous hates the Laws because he fears them; the religious man respects them because he loves them: The first hates the virtue, because he lacks of it, and doesn't want strain himself to gain it, while the second loves it {the virtue} because he finds in it something (where to see himself) {reflected like in a mirror} because he has gained it through effort.

PAGES: 47-50

~...~ Second: It has already been observed, that no big Incredulous has ever written a good book, useful to the Public, and that has been liked by the good Literates more then a spring. The reason for that, is that not only because the Incredulous are always lecherous but (rather) because they are neither animated into writing by some sublime motive, nor they are moved by purposes and principles greater than those that are seen and touched with the eyes and with the hands, despite they would want to always talk about the most sublime matters, and superior to their strengths and their studies. Therefore it is observed that the Incredulous often go highly enough but rather helped by the Lightnesses {levity} than by an intrinsic strength; or if they fly, they do it with just one wing, with that one {wing} of their wishes alone, and of their opinion alone \(like saying this pun\) and not also with the wing of judgement of others; and yet, having just made that fly, they crash down like a rock. As I have already said this will look like a pun, but it is in fact a formidable truth and we have a thousand examples of similar falls. The incredulous, generally about things of the spirit {humour}, correspond to our *merchants of fashions* that do not see that what is needed by a passenger is frivolous pleasure and mostly ornaments and girlish trifles; That that is worse, however, has been observed, \(and it is very true\), {is} that the Incredulous, that suppose Religion to be a fable, always want to talk about matters belonging to the Religion, and that they have always fallen in certain {things} that appear to be misterious contradictions and errors. Be careful to the contradictions and the errors written by [A.] in this Little Book of his, *of Crimes and Punishments*, and it will be seen impossible to be able to conceive how a man of his talent and of his ability, and energy, could have been able to crash down. He has committed himself to prove that the punishment of death, that is given to certain crimes, is cruel and useless, without thinking beforehand, to reassamble mankind differently from what it is. It doesn't say anything new or anything that hasn't already been examined and written; and it is not seen any difference between him, and the other Writers of similar Argument, if not that [A.] brings the same reasons already proposed by others, but always with a Sword at hand, with which pierces barbarically, and truncates any thing that opposes his furor, or that meets on the way. And it will be seen moreover, that still, he has fallen to his shame, in all the errors and defects in which, as it has been observed, have crashed unfortunately all the Incredulous. One thing at a time.
~And of Punishements. \(a\) Pag. 31. art.1~ After that [A.] has said that very reasonably \(a\) that: *the political end of the punishments is nothing but to prevent the guilty from doing new damange to his Citizens, and to remove others from doing those {crimes} like it*; and after having well reasoned even of the *credibility* of the Witnesses \(b\), he descends to treat about the *Secret Accusations* \(c\). ~\(b\) ... . \(c\) Pag. 33. Art.2 Of Secret Accusations~ But before reporting what [A.] writes of this sort of Accusations, for the better intelligence than what he writes about it, makes one reflect upon misteries.
I. First: That in all times, all centuries and in all Nations, there have been always found certain men, turbulent by their nature, seditious, very audacious, and very loving of news in the Government and in the States, and this into (proportion) {relation} that they hoped to find, and that they actually find {found} , some other men of the same character {disposition}; and in relation still, of the minor, or major obstacles that were opposing or favouring their (drawings) {schemes}.
II. It shall be reflecten, in second place, that despite there is a lascking of an exact history, of all the Conspiracies, of all the Rebellions, and of all the Seditions (followed) {occurred} in all the Reigns and in all the different Republics of the World; with all that, {that has been acquired} from the reading of just those that have been left to us, and that are found among the various annals, these three truths, and observations, can be obtained.
1. That the Seditions, and the Rebellions and the Consiracies are in grave number, and have always occurred whenever there have been (found) Reigns and Republics.
2. That all the seditions, and the Rebellions that have happened, have been the cause of grave damage to the States where they have broken out.
3. That very little could have been enough to prevent entirely, or to make so that they were less strong, and less damaging, the said Rebellions, Seditions, etc., and that without doubt, almost all could have been prevented by forming, and preserving a Magistrate, that supervised particularly (against) {on} the Seditions, and the Conspiracies, and that had the (inspection) {control, zeal} of receiving, with most secrecy, the accusations, and delations against the enemies of the calmness of the states, to recognize them, and to punish them severely, according to the gravity of the faults. To such tribunal, all mankind would have been debtor, of the blood, and of the life, of an uncountable number of men.

PAGES: 50-53

Having supposed all this as undeniable, I say that even if the creation of a Magistrate that is receiving the secret accusations of the crimes against the State, that is convicting and punishing the perpetrators outside of the judicial order, and that is not ever disclosing the the Delators, rather that he is rewarding them, even in the case of finding some slanderer, even if, I was saying, all these things seem and are indeed odious, terrible and prone to cause the ruin of some innocent, despite those, and I repeat, all the things noted above, the establishment of a Tribunal, that would receive the secret accusations, and the contrivance to keep the subjects in {a state of} mistrust among themselves, it has to be judged, and believed, a Tribunal to be the most useful and advantageous for all the States, and the (masterpiece) {head of operations} of humane Politics, to save the human blood, and the only mean, that could be used to this matter, until men don't change nature, and I hope that nobody will think the opposite, if not those narrow minds, and annoyed by that fact that they don't see how among ourselves, good is not given without some meddling of bad; and that can't distinguish the positive good and bad, from the negative bad and good.
Lets see now how [A.] indeed talking of the *Secret Accusations*, shows to have a narrow mind, and limited in that manner, such that it moves to disdain.
Here's how he writes about it. *An evident, but consecrated disorder, and in many Nations, made necessary by the weakness of the constitution, are the secret accusations.* \(a\) Where he follows it by saying. ~\(a\) Pag.33 lin. 22.~ *Such custom makes men false and covered. Anyone who can suspect to see in others a delator, sees in him an enemy. The men, then, get accustomed to hide their true sentiments, and with the habit of hiding them from others, they lastly come to hide them from themselves.* Then he asks like so: *And we would make of these men, the intrepid Soldiers defenders of the Homeland and of the Throne? And among those, will we find the incorruptible Magistrates, that with free, and patrioctic eloquency would sustain and develop the true interests of the Sovereign......Who can defend himself from the Calumny, when it {the calumny} is armed with the strongest shield of tiranny, the Secret? What sort of goverment is ever that where who rules, suspects in everyone of his subjects an enemey, and is forced, for the public rest, to remove it {the Secret} from everyone?* As it seems, he expects that such habit is caused by the inconvenients listed below. *1. That it would make men (false) {liars} and covered {shrouded} 2. That whoever suspect seeing in others a delator, would see an enemy. 3. That men get used to mask their sentiments, and that by the habit of hiding them from others, they get to hiding them from themselves. 4. That neither intrepid defenders of the Patria and the Throne could be made from such lost, fluctuanting, insecure men; nor could be found, among those, incorruptible Magistrates, that with true and Patriotic eloquence would sustain and develop the true interests of the Sovereigns. 5. That nobody will be able to defend himself from calumny, because {it would be} armed with the strongest shield of Tiranny, the Secret.*
To destroy now all these difficulties, and to make all the alleged incovenients disappear let's do this. Let's put on one side all the imaginable disorder that [A.] finds in the habit of the secret Accusations, and all the inconvenients that he himself supposes that the said Habit would have to deliver and on the other side the frights, the perils, the massacres and all the other consequences of a conspiracy or a rebellion. Having done this I ask to any politician and any reasonable men, which side should we choose, the inevitable horrors and massacres of a rebellion, or the disorders and the remote inconvenients and (imaginaries) {fictions} that could be born from the habit of the secret accusations? All will answer me that it will be infinitely less bad to suffer the inconvenients of the Secret accusations, even if they were a hundred times greater than that, that the Author has enlarged to us.
Someone, although, could tell me here, that the answer is fine in case a choice has been really forced; but that is a case that could be avoided by saying either that there aren't dangers of Uprisings anymore, or by affirming that to keep them away, and prevent them, public accusations could suffice, examined and punished according the (same) {known} order of punitive justice.



PAGES: 53-56

I reply, that the Experience of all the Centuries has proven us that the first case is as much inevitable as it is impossible in the current state of things, that all the subjects are loyoal ones. About the second, I say, that it is not possible to find another mean to avoid a rebellion, neither more secure, nor more expedited, nor less costly and not even more effective of the one of the secret Accusations; considering that the public (ones) have never produced a true effect, of such {statement} there is no need of proof.
I have said, that the mean of the secret Accusations, if the most *secure* because it is certain that those that have best practiced it have tested it to be very secure and (also) because on one (part) {side}, the subjects don't dare to (uncover themselves) with anyone, because they fear, that all are capable of accusing them, and from the other {side} because if they talked behind the Government, (in preference of many) {for the common good}, it could always be found someone, that to earn something, wouldn't be afraid of being the delator even more since he is certain of being kept secret. And even more secure, because if the seditious is powerful, his capture, and his death (because all private and secret) will not give (field) {room} to accomplices ed relatives to rise and to make commitments, and on the contrary, after discovering it, they will remain even intimidated and scared.
I said afterwards, more *expedited*, and this is manifested, because in similar cases there are very few formalities, as in examining the perpetrators, as in condemning them, and make them die; and also because here we suppose, that there is a Magistrate established {settled} to that effect.
I have said moreover, less costly, because very few Ministers can be enough to execute a commission, and a very secret and private operation; in case one would want to prevent Uprisings and Conspiracies by continuously keeping (standing) {up} a large number of armed men, then in addition to the great cost, there would be to fear for other (part) {things}.
I said, finally, that the Magistrate of the secret Accusation is the most effective to reach his goal, because a similar Magistrate instils more fear, exactly because (arcane) {mysterious}, more secret, more expedited, (without appeal, terrible) {in other words, terrible?}.
It could be enough what has been said up to this point, for {a} (full) {complete,thorough} answer to the difficulties put in place from [A.] against the use of *Secret Accusations*, but in this way I am not happy. I want to satisfy him (end to end) {line by line}. I will only premise that in all the States, it reigns always the custom to maintain and award some Delators, and to receive the secret accusations, since it is certain, that there has never been a lack of unfair people that has spontaneously performed this infomous professio, either for vile earnings, or to gain revenge on an enemy of his, or to earn the grace of whom governs the States.
I, however, have not said so to oppose to the Adversary the universal use of all the Sovereignties but for the reason I will say now. Again.
What is the end of the custom of the Secret Accusations? Of what type are the Crimes, that want to get known through these Secret Accusations? What is, at last, the use that one has of such Accusations? The primary goal of the secret Accusations is to know the enemies of the States, and to know everything that could perturb the Government, and the Society, in order to repair it. Another end for which the well (affectioned) {endorsed} by the government watch over his security, is so that everyone will be cautious when they speak of those things that they mustn't know, and that they don't (intend) {comprehend}. Can there be an end more reasonable and commendable than this?
The crimes, then, that it is attempted obtain from the secret Delators, are all those that immediately offend the Government and the State. Now I ask, what (worsening) makes the Sovereign to his subjects because he searches, and wants to be informed of these type of Crimes? What do we loose since we are not allowed to pubicly examine the affairs of the State? How many moments of happiness will we loose, more or less , as we are not allowed to talk of those things that we do not know? (On the contrary) {from the other side}, how many benefits couldn't we earn, if we loved, and praised with reason, the things of the State of which we are subjects? As for me, I would regret if I would be forbidden to praise the Wisdom of the Government, all the times it deserved it, but that it would prohibit me to be an {evil speaker}, it appears to me rather more a blessing than a (burden) {curse}.
And to which end would we want our freedom to be able to censor the Politics of the State, to remedy the errors of the same, or simply in order to have the milignant pleasure to speak bad about it? The second one is a pretension that can't be supposed. As for the first one, the Magistrates will always welcome the enlightnings and the good suggestions that to the same {magistrates} are respectfully presented by the subjects zealous of the public good.

PAGES: 56-59

Finally, the use that is known by the Ministers of all the peaceful Governments, of the Secret Accusations, is the most just and wise that could be hoped for by Government men, whom very unlikely would want to listen to columnious Delators, and from whom it is even more unlikely to fear an injust punishment; because they don't rest on the simple accusations of the Delators, because they examine the quality of the accusations; because they distinguish {discern} the accused people; (and it is not difficult to decide whether certain persons are capable of committing crimes against the state or not) because such Magistrates are always made (of) {from/among} the most enlightened ,the most credited and the most discrete people of the State, and because for few rare example of blunder picked in ten centuries from some Minister, there could be produced infinite, in which they {the ministers} have (used) {applied} an execess of mercy and clemency.
I add above all this, that the use of the secret Accusations, even being from a Magistrate not at all despotic, is made absolutely necessary, wherver is found established the depotism of many; and this {is so} even by confession of [A.] himself (a) ~a. Pag.12)~ where he teaches that *the despotism of the many is not correctable, if not by the despotism of the one*.
Coming, afterwards, to the alleged disorders of the secret Accusations; it brings surprise that [A.] has not felt shame about not mentioning them, being an assumption that makes men false and shrouded, while he notes, for experience, that regarding sincerity, men of all Nations are the same everywhere; or better that the subjects that live in those States where the Magistrate of the secret Accusations has more authority and vigor are more sincere loyal than those that live somewhere else. This couldn't happen if not in a State where there were delators and secret punishments for all the genres of crimes.
He wrongfully complains likewise, *the whoever sees in others a delator, will presume him an enemy*; primarily because the Delators are roughly all known, and then because, we see that despite the number of the Delators, men live (well united) everywhere; and moreover, because to fear that everyone could become an enemy of oneanother (reciprocally) is a useful suspicion as much for the individuals as for all Society. There isn't anything that could cause baleful disunities in the Societies as the excessive unity of subjects.
I answer to the third, that, that that makes so that men grow accustomed to (masking) their sentiments is not the feat of the Delators, but a evil (bottom) that is found in them; and it should be supposed that the Nations of Europe, are for more made of unfair Delators, to fear that all the honest people could become accustomed to duplicity.
To the fourth supposed disorder, it is answered, that this is also contrary to experience, which unfortunately has shown that the subjects of the most despotic Governments, have been, and are nevertheless valorous soldiers, passionate defenders of the Country and the Throne; and some eminent, incorruptible, very eloquent Magistrates; as we know to the contrary, the subjects of some already free States, where all the human errors were tolerated, had all those defects that [A.] attributes to the use of secret Accusations.
The last inconvenient that [A.] adduces, as deriving from that kind of accusations, namely *that nobody could defend himself from calumny* is completely imaginary, because as I have said, the Magistrates that judge such Accusations, are able to distinguish enough {of} the Calumny from the Fact {Deed}, and proceed with all the rules appripriate justice, and befitting certain cases; although such disorder is as hurtful to Sovereigns, as to Societies, so that he supposes all of them made of infamous delators and calumniators.
At last others should see if writing that *the strongest shield of tiranny is the secret* presently within Italy, is deliberate; and I run to see that which [A.] has written about the *Torture*, that to the judgment of many is the best reasoned subject of his Book.
I find ,therefore, the he starts talking like this (a)~Pag 35.Art.1 Of Torture~ *A cruelty, consecrated from the usage of most of the Nations is the Torture of the reo, while the Trial is (formed).* Thus the Author, and I confess, me too, despite having never seen a person being tortured, feel, anyway, so much horror to this kind of torment, that it seems to me that everybody should rather choose to be [mazzolati] <wiki/Mazzatello>, than suffer the atrocities of such torment. My blood, and my waist, grow stiff simply by imagining it; despite all this I argue that [A.] condemns without reason the use of *Torture*, or at least that the reasons that he brings, aren't such that would oblige us to condemn it {the use}, as useless as he himself claims.
I don't say that Torture doesn't cause atrocious and cruel pains, and that in order of pain, it is not atrocious; I affirm only that as *punishment* it can be just, as it is also Death, and moreover that the use of this torment as it is practiced in our Courts is also useful, not only because it is needed as (justification) {validation?} to Justice but even for the same Rei.
I will prove my proposition after saying in which cases it is being made use of Torture.
Torture, therefore, like even other more crude torments, is certain that are not put in practice if not very rarely, and against very grave rei, and deserving of death; or in few extraordinary cases, against persons from whom it is pressing and useful to the Public, to have some news on the fact; and in some State Torture is even given as ensured purgation of infamy, and to disclose the accomplices of some delinquents condemned to death.

PAGES: 59.62-65

Regarding the first case, torturing the Reo bring vain and unjust is such a (far way) {far fetched} {thought} that I wouldn't be scared to affirm that it {torturing} is rather an act of mercy that Justice uses against the same rei. Judjement shouldn't be hurried. Isn't it true that Torture is given only to the crazy rei (of Death) {condemned to death} to retrieve the confession and the ratification of their crimes, and that if these {rei} resist to such a torment, despite rei condemned to death, they avoid the the agony and the infamy? Torture, therefore, can, for what is stated above, be considered as a mean that can save the life of some reo, although as a charitable thing rather than cruel.
I grant [A.] that a man can't be called *Reo* before the sentence of the Judge but I denie that a man can't indeed be reo, even before being sentenced to be such. Like that are all the rei condemned in the Courts of Italy, where to formally condemn a reo to death, it is not enough for him to be convicted but it is even more necessary for him to be also confessed. It is here, then, where the equivocation and the sophism of the Author lie, founded {based} on the name *Reo* by which others mean *convicted reo* and others *confessed reo*.
And one shall say: If it is true that someone is a reo condemned to death, why, then, torment him? Here it is the equivocation of [A.], he is not tormented as certain and convicted reo, but as disobedient and sacrilegious, and determined to not wanting to confess the crimes of which he is a convicted reo; and the Torture that is given for simile disobedience to convicted rei of crimes deserving death, is used for really just and really useful motives, although not in the single case in which a reo refuses to confess the crimes of which he is a convicted reo; and I reply, that in such case a reo is not tortured, because reo, as our Author supposes and misunderstands, but simply as a (grave) disobedient to his Legitimate Judges of the Matter, and as one that shamelessly and sacrilegiously the truth known and impedes so the course of Justice, which by prudents and merciful considerations doesn't want to let anybody die, without having confessed by themselves the crimes for which he is convicted. The capricious Dilemma quickly melts like so. The answer will bring bother, but it can't be done otherwise.
If the crime is certain, no other punishment befits better than the one established by the Laws: I distinguish: no other punishment befits the *crime*, for which the Reo is made worthy of death, I grant it; I denie it to the *Reo*. In a clearer way *no other punishment befits the Reo*. I distinguish how the reo of the supposed, certain, and proved crime, I grant it; as Reo of another crime, that is, of the one of grave disobedience against his legitimate Superiors, and as perjury and for the very just deliberations of Justice, mentioned above, I denie it.
It should be seen, now, if I haven't (said with reason) {spoken to reason}, so that an honest man should regret answering such Arguments with such an abhorrent form; And how should we be able to convince certain people, to whom objects don't present themselves, if not all in one piece, that they are composed, in reality, of a thousand pieces?
After all it is not a scantly grave fault, the one of a *Reo*, whom legitimately questioned from his Judge, refuses to confess the truth. I know I will make [A.] and others of his same characther laugh. I will say, anyway, that one of the most learned Pontiffs that has adored the City of the Seven Hills, has judged such disobediency, to be a crime so grave and offensive to the truth and to the Justice that has oblijed, especially all the Confessors, to denied the Sacramental Absolution to those Rei, that legitimately questioned, didn't want to confess the truth *even tough they were certain, that by keeping it unspoken, they would be free, and that confessing they were certain, that they would have been condemned to a cruel death*. This seems, I confess, a very severe doctrine, but only to those that don't have the Doctrine, the (penetration) {insight}, and the reasonable clemency of that great Pope.

PAGES: 65-67

Let's see the other reason that [A.] adds against the use of Torture. *I add more* \(says [A.]\)\(a\) ~Pag.15~ *that to require that a man is at the same time the accuser and the accused is a wish to confuse all relationships; that the pain became the crucible of truth, almost like the criterion of it resided in the Muscles and fibers of a miserable {man}: this is the sure mean to absolve the tough scoundrels and to condemn the weak innocents.*
This difficulty is yet supported by the two false beliefs, that the confession of the reo is an accusation, and that Torture is given to the innocents. It is not so. The Judge does not demand the confession of the reo as an accusation of his crimes, almost if he doubted for him being reo or not, while if he doubted it, he wouldn't let him be tortured; He wants the confession from the reo for the effect that we have said above. Moreover, Judges are not so little Philosophers that they would think that the pain would become *the crucible of truth*; They do not seek the truth from the pain, but from the reo; because they already know it, and if they didn't truly know it, they wouldn't put the reo in this *crucible* as we have said already; They only seek for that crucible to force the rei to satisfy their duty, that is to confess the evil of which they are convicted. It is a gawky and reckless mockery to say in this place that torture *is the sure mean to absolve the tough scoundrels and to condemn the weak innocents*; because Judges don't torture scoundrels because they are weak or tough, but because they suppose both of them to be rei; and both of them fairly suffer torture.
And I don't want to omit to let {others} observe the clemency of Sovereigns, whose don't allow, for torture to be suffered by those rei that are struck by some grave incommodious, that would make the same {rei} succumb to the tortures. And if a Japanese or an inhabitant of California, not informed of European Laws, read the *Book* that we examine here, would have reason to judge that the Courts and the Sovereigns of *Europe* are just as much very cruel Tyrants, and their subjects, the most unhappy, and stupid people of the Earth.
~\(a\)same page~ New disagereement *It is important* \(he says\(a\)\) *that any obvious crime would not be unpunished; but it is useless to ascertain the crime of a man that is buried in the darkness of uncertainty*; and it shall be quickly read hereafter this very small maxim; *A wrong already committed, to which there is no remedy, can't be punished by the political Society, if not for the influence {that is has} upon others, through the flattery of impunity*.
I try: \(that the question is legitimate\) Would [A.] leave unpunished a man that made a grave offense to him, wit h the fear that the offender would make even worse afterwards? Would he live unpunished such a man, on the thought that *the evil already made, is without remedy, made privately and known only to him alone?* I leave the jokes and I warn that such disagreement is not as much as against the use of Torture, as it is against the necessity to generally punish all the crimes. I reply, anyways, that it is frantic to affirm it to be pointless to ascertain the crime of a reo, that is buried in the darkness of uncertainty; and I speak like this because in this spot, the uncertainty is imaginary and doesn't have any intentions; a crime worthy of Torture is never completely private; otherwise a scoundrel couldn't, and shouldn't ever be punished; and right away, since it is in the hands of Justice, it {the justice} has to judge, and judge publicly; while it is always supposed that in the most private crimes, the accusators, the High and Low Ministers of justice, (ecc.) would take part.
Regarding that maxim of [A.] besides what I have mentioned, everyone must persuade himself {to think that}, if it was adopted by Judges, they should never condemn anybody anymore, because almost all the greatest crimes are followed privately.
[A.] at the same time errs to suppose that private crimes wouldn't influence Society with their evil, being obvious that if the scoundrels were left unpunished, as soon as they were let loose they would commit new crimes, with even more violence, since they have seen that private crimes are not punished. He even supposes with little care that there is not remedy to the evil of private crimes, because it is remedied enough by finding the private crimes, punish the offenders, and prevent that they would commit new ones.

PAGES: 67-69

[A.] has put the three arguments reported, against the use of Torture in the case it is required to extract the confession from the reo, and then he comes again \(a\) to condemn that one that is used against the rei ~\(a\)pag. 38 art. 2~ when during their examination they fall into contradictions, *almost like *\(he says\)* the fear of the punishment, the uncertainty of the judgment, the apparatus, and the majesty of the Judge, and the ignorance which is common to all the (scoundrels) {villains}, and all the innocents, should probably not let falling into contradictions, and the innocent, that fears, and the reo, that tries to cover himself.*
And lets yet reply here, this are very rare cases, that don't deserve (the loss of) the very useful (use) {application} of Torture against the criminals persistent in not confessing the truth; the constitued, moreover,  are tormented not for all the contradictions of a reo, and the Judges are neither so much crass nor so much cruel that they wouldn't know how to distinguish the contradictions, malicious, of the guilty from those slipped by ignorance, and said because of too much confusion and for very little discernment; and that they would want to torment ignorance and stupidity. Is it possible that [A.] has so much compassion for the villains since he supposes all the Judges and all the Sovereigns capable of the cruel villainy of tormenting criminals, just because they are ignorant and for similar lightweight flaws and shortcomings? Therefore, not even for this argument, Torture given to the rei on behalf of their iniquitous contradictions, must be condemned.
To the last argument he follows up with another that is not even reasonable, rather ridiculous. ~\(a\) Pag.40 art.2~ * The examination of a reo *\(\(a\) this is the new argument of [A.]\)* is done to know the truth.* And I denie that the examination is done to know the truth; while it is certain that it is done to put it in a more juridical light, through the access to the confession of the rei themselves. It is shame that I should outline here the very notable information that the Judge can't proceed to the examination of a reo, without preempting clues, and information sufficient {to prove} guiltiness. Again, then. *The examination of a reo is done to know the truth, but this truth unlikely uncovers itself to the air, the jesture, to the physiognomy of a man, in which the convulsions caused by pain, alter all signs, for which from the face of the majority of men, sometimes transpires the truth*.
Even granted, that the truth does not transpire through men both in the act of being tormented, and during tranquility, this should not prevent the belief that it is pointless the use of tormenting the rei, because these are not tormented (for use) {freely} of the Designers, but for enlightenment and (news) {knowledge} of the Judges that attend to the voice, and not the physiognomy. Afterall, the notion that uncovering the truths inside of men put in a state of tranquility is easier than when put to Torture is false. Just the appartus of the torments has mad miracles to many rei, in order to make them confess immediately the truth, and so that they would give on the fact the most undoubted clues of truly being the rei. And on the opposite the innocents, submitted to the torments, almost all have soffered them in a way so that it was known that they were truly innocent.

PAGES: 69-72

I sustain, however, that there isn't a better time {moment} in which either the innocence or the iniquity of a man, openly transpires than when {a man} finds himself in the middle of torments. If a man is truly a Philosopher, and has reflected upon himself, I say that he will be able to become master of himself, enough that it is impossible to be able to know, either from his words, or from the outside of his behavior, if he says the truth or not, if he is in pain, or calm, and if he is guilty or innocent. What, then, has to be judged of this [A.] whom at page 39 outrightly states that: *Is{n 't} it as (little free) {constrained} to say the truth between spasms and torments as it is to prevent the effects of fire?* Either he wants to (impose) {order} us, in case he shows off his (science) {knowledge} in history, or he aspires to deceive the Public, because everybody knows it to be countless the number of those Christians that have confirmed their faith among the most atrocious torments, that have made as much, the false Martyrs of the Heretical sects.
We are here to the last shot, or how they say, at the cannon lane, or rather the (campaigns) {lands} (sweeper), that [A.] has turned against the use of Torture. ~\(a\) Same page art.2~ *These truths* \(says \(a\)\) *have been known by Roman Legislators, from whom no Torture has been found used, except upon just the slaves, whom were stripped of every (personality) {identity}. These {truths?}, England, Nation, where the glory of the Letters, the Superiority of Commerce, and of Riches, and therefore of Power, the examples of virtue and courage, don't leave us doubting of the kindness of the Laws itself has known. Torture has been abolished in Sweden, abolished by one of the most wise Monarchs of Europe, that has brought Philosophy on the Throne, Legislator amicable with his subjects, has made them equals, and free in the dependency of the Laws, that is the only equality and freedom that reasonable men can demand in the current (combinations of things). Torture is not believed to be necessary from the Laws of the Armies, made up mostly of the scum of the Nations, that would seem, accordingly, the class which would make use of it more than any other*. And here he ends with this [epifonema] {exclamation}: *It is a strange thing that who does not consider how big it is the Tiranny of the use, that the peaceful Laws have to learn, from the hearts hardened to massacres and blood, the most humane method to judge.*
It is possible, now, to find any mean by which divert and ground such a discharge? Would it be possible to oppose something to daze such a terrible shot? Would it be possible to find any answer against an example so authoritative and with so much weight? Since I know there being a great difference between a custom introduced without a mature and public exam and consent of one or of many Nations, and one approved after many exams and many researches, I could, anyway, answer to this last opposition of [A.] by making use of his own weapons, with which he puts himself against the use of giving the death penalty which is followed {the use} by all the Nations of the universe, and saying yet: \(a\) ~\(a\)Pag. 64~ *If it would be posed to me the example of almost all the Centuries and almost all the Nations that have given the death penalty to some crimes, I will answer that it is annihilated in face of the truth... that the history of men gives us the idea of an immense pelago of errors ec.* As I was saying I could answer too, to the arguments of this [A.]. In fact, if it was valid the argument taken out from the example, and from the authority, I know, still, that the most false things could be proved true and the most true and (obvious) could be proven false. And I don't need such kind of weapons to break down the authority of which it is spoken about. I just feel sorry that I will not have to answer to everything, and demonstrate in how much deception finds himself [A.] about the strength that he thinks to be present in the given examples. They are here.
The Roman legislators have not used Torture to obtain the confession of the Rei because they didn't have yet felt the necessity of such a usage, because they weren't within reach to examine this matter (as it was befit) {for the better, in a proper way} and because the Revolutions of their Republic have almost never left their State entirely peaceful, nor reduced the different classes, and conditions of people to a fixed system in order to examine and establish which was the best method to (criminally process); in fact it has been very imperfect in all his parts, and more irregularly followed, as we know from many Facts.

PAGES: 7-12

~About the Social contract~ But the said proposition of [A.] can be accused of dangerous imprudence, what shall be said of the confident bluntness through which he utters the following {sentence}? \(2\) Let's open the stories {Let's start discussing} \(says him\) and we shall see that the Laws, that also are, or should be pacts among free men, have not been, mostly, nothing but the instrument of the passions of some few {men}, or born from a fortuitous, and temporary necessity, not already examined by a cold examiner of the human nature.
[A.] here supposes like the most part of modern (publicists) {writers}, that the civil society have originated, and that have been formed from the (accord) of free and isolated men, united together in order to better secure their lives {achieve stability}, and that to such object {goal} {they} had also formed some Laws, and elected various people \(without doubts of their (number) {of their ranks}\) so that they would be custodians and executors of those Laws.
This hypothesis and this principle, is the foundation and the base upon which [A.] lays everything that he forwards about the nature of the punishments and, and of the crimes in this Book of his, and likewise the same {hypothesis and principle} upon which recumbent he disapproves and condemns through frequent invectives, and declamations, the method, and the manner with which one judges, and {one} thinks universally in all the Nations about the same matter of crims and punishments. From this same hypothesis [A.] deduces many pernicious consequences contrary to straight reason, contrary to the right of sovereignty of all the countries of our World, and contrary to the true Religion; and to say everything in one word, upon this hypothesis it is founded everything that it is written in this Book of his ; in a way that if I demonstrate that one such hypothesis is false, and absurd, it will be left demolished, and destroyed all the bulk of the Systems and of the projects, that are found in this Book, upon the said matter of crimes and Punishments. I support {argue} now, that really the hypothesis of the origin of the Societies as [A.] presents here is false, and absurd, and I have the vanity {pride} to protest {affirm/expostulate}, that if I won't prove it such {false}, I am happy {agree with the fact}, that one shall quickly throw {away} this Writing of mine, and to be judged an impostor. 
To form a Civil society these three things are required. 1. The consent of Free men, and isolated, as [A.] speaks. 2. The creation of the Laws, and of the (agreements) that have to serve for the good governance of the Society; 3. And the election of some people so that they make one execute such Laws {in order for such laws to be executed}.
After these suppositions, two things can be researched: 1. If there has ever been some Republic, or some Kingdom, that have formed themselves from the free consent of all the men that inhabited some Province, (conforming) the modern Writers suppose, so that Societies have originated? 2. If it is possible, that Societies could be formed in some manner, pending the present condition of men?
About the first, he is of the most absolute certainty, that there hasn't ever been in our Globe a perfect Society that has been formed originally from the consent expressed and determined by Free men, conforming imagines [A.] and I challenge all the socialists, and anyone else, to find me just one example in all History, and in all the Annals of the World, of Societies formed in that manner. Everything that can be observed from History, about the origin of the Republics, and the Empires, and about their enlargment {expansion}, as well as about their revolutions, and their decadence {decline} too, it has always been the case that the law of the fittest has prevailed, but for (some) circumstances, and combinations, that it is seen in it, \(judging correctly\) the work, and the concourse {intervention} of an hand invisible, but very powerful. Let's meanwhile keep {consider} it certain, that there never have been Societies, conforming what [A.] and the modern Writers suppose them to be.
Let's see now if it is possible, that men of the current condition could form, the Society of which here it is spoken. In the first place, one must suppose, that to form a Society a number of men is required from which to make and assign to Leaders of Society, Judges, ministers, etc. Now the free men that have to form the Society of which it is treated, either they are going to be all of the same age, same sex, and same condition, or of different age, sex and condition. If we will suppose, that they are all of the same age, we will see that it is inconceivable to be possible to find a hundred men that solely those think all in the same manner, that all have the same passions, and the same interests. It is superfluous, to observe here that there are as many different opinions, and wishes, as the diffrenet men's heads. If it is hard that men convene all to believe the same in some scientific point, that interests very little {of very little interest}; how much more it is going to be hard that they convene, and that everyone comes to an agreement to bring the same judgment around matters as much interesting for everybody, as the Laws through which we have to be ruled are, and bound for all the time that we shall live, and that they {the men} could easly agree, in the election of those that have to rule them {the men}? Who is that man, that wants to do this wrong to himself of not to believe himself to be as able as another to rule the Society? Who is that free man, and (at best) if it was some [Spirito Forte], who wants to subject himself to the government of his equals? One shall ignore entirely what is the human heart, and what is the strength of the love for oneself, to persuade himself, that it could be possible to find a large number of men that want to sacrifice spontaneously their own freedom in the hands of other men, and that they could convene, to create, and form the chains with which they have to live tied up for all {the rest of} the time of their life.
(That) if those that have to form the Society shall be of different age, sex and condition; then the difficulty that they could convene, to give their consent, as well as to make the Laws, and the magistrates, will grow in proportion to the number of the major combinations, that form, the opinions and the interests of many people of age sex and condition very different. The Youth are always against the Old ones, as the moderns are against the (ancients), one shall also add here the difference of passions, and of the interests of many people, ona shall add more, the difficulty to make the Laws that befit many different ages and conditions of people, and one shall see, that it is not possible to find a population even if small, that unites itself to give his consent, to make Laws, elect Magistrates, form a perfect Society, namely, the most difficult, and the greatest deed that could be made by men.
In every small number of men there are some misanthropes, some fanatics, some (wrathful), and some [Spiriti Forti], as well as to the complete opposite there never won't be lacking some weak men, stupid, unreasonable; How could someone ever imagine, that this kind of men wanted, and could lend his consent in order to create a society? It is not credible, that if there was a soul like those of [Machiavelli], or of [Galileo], he {the soul} wanted to agree with the many, and subject himself to the Laws, and to the government of men inferior to them{,} it could (never always) be thought about a code of Laws, and of their goodness {fitness} as of the Systems of the Philosophers and of the (Plans) of Religion everything would be put in doubt, and in constrast, it would be necessary to renew the Laws every age, and generation of men. Men believe to have the right to spoil the works of other men. One shall combine now all those things, and one shall see how true it is, that it is not possible, it could be found a population even if small, that want, and that can convene and form a perfect, and well regulated Society.

PAGES: 72-75

It is certain, then, that in almost all Nations, and in all epochs, and all Centuries, Crimes worthy of death and the proofs deemed sufficient to convince, that a man has truly commited a crime worthy of death, it is certain, I say, that the idea of such things, it has been more or less always the same, in everybody; since it is also the same among all modern Nations, as much Englishmen for instance as Italians research the same grade of certainty of the crimes of a reo, that deserve death, and both decree almost the same punishment, for the same crimes. Therefore there will not be between these two Nations other difference in criminally proceeding against a reo but this one; that is that Englishen, and other Nations, condemn to death without looking for the confession of the reo, and that Italians don't condemn to death nobody without having obtained the confession of the reo beforehand; and in England, for a reo, after certain proofs of his crimes, it is not possible to avoid death and infamy; and to the contrary, in Italy, it is possible that a reo, with the same given proofs of guiltiness, could avoid it. It is asked , now, to every sincere and unprejudiced man; which of these methods of proceeding to the conviction of rei, is the most favorable to the same rei, more cautious, safer and not even susceptible to mistakenly condemn to death, the one of England, or that of Italy? The english one, according to which the death sentence is given without the confession of the reo, or the italian one according to which the reo is not condemned to death without him confessing his crimes, either spontaneously or forced by torments? ...
For what pertains me, I wouldn't esitate one moment to affirm that it is more favorable to the rei, more cautious, safer and not susceptible to mistakes in his convictions an Italian Judge, that allows the Torture apparatus, and wants the confession of the rei beforehand, than an English Judge that proceeds to the sentence based upon the deposition of witnesses only and with the simple recognition of the body of the crime, that is, with less formalities and with more frank expediency.
Such is my opinion on this matter, and I calculate the convulsions of torture, that some profane villains (call for), or even to some innocent, to zero, while compared to the advantages that the Italian method of condeming brings to all Society, all the rei worthy of death, and even to those that suffer and and resist to Torture.
Everything that I have said hiere, about the method of Englishmen, should be said even against the example of Romans, Swedes, Prussians, all of which would proceede as it is done in Italy, if they could see in all its extension, the good that such a method causes among us, and the bads, that it allows us to avoid; and they would know, moreover, which ones, and how many, have been the motives that deemed necessary, to require the confession itself from the rei, before irrevocably condeming them to death.
Regarding, then, the example of the Romans, it could be added, that the justice and the humanity, of the castigations and the punishments, of the ancient Quirites, have been (op)posed very little to that of modern Italians, and others, because it is known, that those descendants of Romolo have been jjust, and humane, only with their own co-republicans, and barbarians and unjust against all the other Nations.
I console myself, that England is a Nation that enjoys the glory of the Letters, the superiority of Commerce, of riches, and even, therefore, more powerful, and I rejoice indeed, of its examples of virtue and courage; However, I know which are the Religion, and customs of almost all the different Nations, without knowing, therefore, which are their Laws, nor by which accuracy they are executed. I have seen, moreover, a phenomenon such that many rich, glorious and Literate men, were at the same time the most inept to govern themselves. I know, moreover, which are the vitues, that the spirit of Commerce and Trade influence, unless someone has proven that the most rich and powerful Empires, have always been the happiest and governed by the best laws, as I at the same time ignore whether History tells us that the corruption of customs and the disregard of the Laws have always (had) (been in) the same epoch, of greatest power of the Empires.

PAGES: 75-76

Anyway, it is of little importance to intend many things, what I would like to say is that [A.] proposes us with little good logic the example of other Nations exactly because not all are the same, not even their laws have to be the same.
That, then, the English, the Swedes, the Swedish and the Prussians have made it into their Laws, either civil or criminal, some reforms opposed to those of other Nations, since {those nations} do the opposite of the Italians in many other things, I do not inquire into it; I rather say that everybody can distinguish the perfection of the custom and of the laws born from a reflective and creative mind, from that that is born simply from the various accidental combination, that could be the effect of fanatism, of spirit of nation, of hate and (pledge), and even be born from a crazy and ambitious love for the ever suspected Novelty.
In short, the usage contrary of some Nations, although respectable, is not an apodeictic proof that the use of Torture as it is practiced in Italy, is truly pointless and unjust.
Even less, then, is this proved from the opposing example of the Armies. The crimes of the Soldier are ordinarily domestic burglaries and disertions, and these can be expedited without the use of Torture, even more so that the Militar can hardly put into practice the formality of the political criminal; and [A.] should know, moreover, that the Militar is exempt from similar formalities, exactly because the Armies \( as [A.] himself says \) * are mostly made of the scum of Nations *.
And from where has [A.] ever heard that the Armies don't make use of Torture for motive of more perfect justice and humanity? The armies have always made so, and it is good to keep doing it like this; but not for this it should *seem strange, that the peaceful Laws don't learn from the minds hardened to massacres and blood, the method to judge*, it has to, rather, seem extravagant that a man of talent, and a scientist would let himself be defeated by the commitment to support a bad cause, that he would propose to all the Nations to imitate the neccessarily rigorous and expeditous custom of punishing that is kept by the honored Militar.
I dare now flatter myself, of having proved that the use of Torture is not unjustly cruel and pointless, and that the reason and the inconvenients {arguments} imagined by [A.] to prove the opposite are not decisive. With all this, I know desire with the most perfect sincerity and passion that all the men live in a manner that they would never have to give Justice the occasion to make use of Torture, and that the adored Justice of all the Sovereigns to be always most clement, and lets leave it here, such somber matter.

PAGES: 76-80

~Of oaths~ After the article about Torture [A.] treats the Oath of Judgement \(a\). I agree with him regarding the substance of his opinion, but I regret his way of talking about it. It hurts me, for example, this proposition: *The affairs of the (skyes) are held with Laws not unlike those that hold the human affairs*: as well as the one {proposition} that affirms that *the Law, which obliges to Oath, commands either to be a bad Cristian, or to be a Martyr* because this is a (pleasure of style) that stinks of sacrilege, other than the fact that it offends the courts that want the Oath or the ones that have already made it once. It hurts me, finally, saying in particular with so much frankness that *each Judge can be a witness that no oath has ever made anyway say the truth*, because I don't believe that all the rei are Free Thinkers.
~Of the readiness of the Punishments~ He follows the article about the Oaths with the one about the *readiness of the Punishments*; but he doesn't say anything that isn't found in thousands of Books in a even more exact and more interesting manner. He only let it transpires his hate and his contempt against the Administrators of Justice. He does the same in the Articles where he deals with the *Violences, Thefts and Infamy*.
Descending, then, to talk about the idlers of the State, he defines the political idleness, and distinguishes the idlers in a way entirely conformant to his mind and his sentiments, such that it deserves observing. ~Of political idleness. \(a\) Pag.51.Art.2~ *I call political idleness* \(says \(a\)\) *that which does not contribute to Society, neither with labor, nor with wealth, that it gains without ever losing, that is revered by the common people with stupid admiration, regarded by the Sage, with disdainful compassion for the Beings that are victims of it, that being void of that stimulus of the active life, that is the necessity to keep, or to increase the leisures of life, leaves to the passions of opinion, that are not the least strong, all their energy. He is not politically idle, who enjoys of the fruits of vices, or of the virtues of his own ancestors, and sells bread for current pleasures, and the existence of industrious poverty, that engages the silent war of industry in peace, with opulence, instead of the uncertain and bloody War.*
Lets go quickly back up, and lets try yet ourselves to simply answer as Philosophers, and as Politicians, despite the fact that such a distinctions, and abstractions, is nowadays as common as it is wickedly cunning, and insulting to the Gospel that does not recognize but one God and one Philosophy.
It is superfluous to warn that the first kind of the idlers that is mentioned and described with colors so infernal from our Politician, are the Religious, especially the caustrals. A great blindness of our most enlightened Century, that calls, and judges idlers, those that more than any other have contributed and contribute nevertheless with their hands, their talent and their example, to the greater benefit and the most perpetual temporal happiness and politics of all the Societies in which they have found themselves and find themselves! Very big ignorance, that arrives to believe and to affirm being more politically idle a man that by his accomodation and dress merely consumes a quarter of that that he could have consumed with damage to Society, if he would have enjoyed living with the most; a man that studies continuously, for his and others erudition, or that helps others to study, and to live as good citizens; a man that with the sole example of the life that he leads, enables a more stable preservation of the order of Society. Big ignorance, I say, that men of such utility are now judged as more politically idle than those that the greater good that can do is to lay inert for the whole course of their life, consuming the most precious substances of the Society, and to destroy the *fruits of the virtues of their ancestors*! I come to say, both as Catholic and as Philosofer, and as Politician, that the ignorance that clutters and obfuscates to our days, the eyes and the mind of certain half Literates, and insane politicians, and that does not let them see the real political utility that the Religious communities bring to men, I come to say, I was saying, that this is a provident punishment from God; because I don't believe being thing more evident than that that almost all the Religious {men}, are either applied to the most useful sciences, or they teach them privately and in the public Universities, or they deal with some mechanic labor, as it can be seen in al the big Libraries where the Ecclesiastical make the primary (celebration) and they are the most precious ornament, as it is done everywhere their most useful inventions are admired. Even the less versed in the histories have seen that has never been found in the world a Reign and a Nation distressed by having always valued and loved religious people or their priests, and Phiolosophers, and that to the contrary, almost all the biggest calamities that Reigns and Empires have suffered, as the ancient ones as the ones closer to us, have had their origin, and their cause, from the little esteem, and from the public contempt against the Religious. And who can't observe, yet presently, that in those Provinces and in those Reigns where the bigger is the number of Religious, or of men that live in the same manner of the Religious, the quieter is the life that is lead compared to where they are not found in such number? That is because they are not just the wealths, nor the sole large population that produce the power and the political Happiness of the Nations, but the good use of the same; In that manner, excatly,  that a man will never be happy albeit healthy, rich, powerful and learned, if he lacks the judgement and the prudency, through which he can make good use of his goods, and without which they would rather be damaging than benefiting.

PAGES: 80-81

Judgement is the prudence in{side} the private men, and that are the Religious in all Societies. Who, therefore, except some ungrateful and inexperienced misbeliever, will ever be able to denie that the Religious corpus {group} doesn't contribute very much to the political good of Societies? It will never be but some blind man, and impious politician, who dares to put this very useful corpus among in the (number) {group} of the idlers. I am sure that it is nothing but the hate toward the true Religion, and the desire of being freed from the reprimand that it makes to the unregulated life of many, the same shadow of the religious virtues, and what makes so that many think sinisterly about the Religious. I am certain, moreover, that none of those that judge with such bluntness that the Religious Communities are not useful to Societies, has deigned to find out what kind of life Ecclesiastic people lead, and that at most they have founded their terrible judgement, on the example of those few religious that have met in squares and some home, namely the imperfect ones, instead of those worthy and very useful Ecclesiastics that lock themselves up in their cloisters exactly to render themselves evermore useful. I am content for religious people to be judged of anything anybody wishes to, provided that such judgement is followed by the judicial order, that is that the matter shall be examined, accusations shall be proposed, defenses shall listened to, and that the sentence shall be made by competed Judges. 
How many men of talent wouldn't have been lost, if they would have stayed in the (Century) that through Religious have become terribly useful to the Public? Which is that Family of some name {famous} in Italy that is not debtor for his glory, and its benefits that it enjoys, to some Priest and some Friar? What optimus effects hasn't produced in the Christian World, the equilibrium, that the Ecclesiastic corpus has created against certain temporal Sovereinties? Religious people are as much useful as necessary in Societies of men as are the Sciences, the good customs and a Religion; even more so, so that it is seen that in all the Nations, and primarily in the Hottest, is always found a certain number of men naturally inclined toward retirement and contemplation. Finally, there isn't something good and useful to the Public that at least partially isn't such by debt to the Religious.
What I have said until now should be received as a simple assay of that lot that I could have said against those inert politicians that furiously declaim against the supposed idleness of the Ecclesiastics; because I (protest) {refer,affirm} that I have written it mostly to reward them {the religious}, then to write the Apologia of the Religious communities. I know that against their purpoted idleness examples of certain (enfrozen) nations are produced. Maybe another opportunity to treat the same argument, although with different uniform, will come to me. Not all that glitters is gold.

PAGES: 81-85

Since everything that is usually opposed to support the political idleness of the Religious is contained in the reported division of this species of idlers made by our [A.], I will have satisfied everyone by answering to his calumnies. He has written such, that the Ecclesiastical *do not contribute to society with their work*; and I affirm that not only the Religious work with their wit, and their hands, but that they provide, and effectively are cause for which others still work, and they do it with as much merit as the pernicious leisure they would have lived if they stayed in their homes. It should be examined which is the expenditure of time of the Religious, and if it has not been found everyone of them dedicated to either studying or schooling, or procuring good order, or to manual labor, or to house (chores, etc. I will be the first to judge the Religious communities as useless. But I remind that it is not just the population and wealth alone that make a State happy, but more, together with Sciences and good customs. Who does not know, now, that the Religious communities are the nurses, the propagators, and the conservators of Science and the sane moral? Aren't the Works that the Ecclesiastical made print a very good (head) {type/kind of goods} of advantagious trade?
[A.] says, then, that the Religions do not contributed to the pubilc good, not even *with their wealth, because they gain without ever loose*. I absolutely denie that the Religions are wealthy and I affirm, that will not be found in all Italy a sole Religious Home that has incomes superior to expenses, that must be made just for the necessary maintenment of their Religious; and that to the opposite a little less than all of them, with great hardship, make up to what is needed for their fod, their clothes and for the costs of the house. And they say that they make some good Factories. It is true, but seculars {workers} are required, and anyway, either they are helped by they seculars, or they (relinquish it) or they use what the Religious have earned with their erudite labors, and with their virtuous industry; However it is, it is certain that building, they give something useful to the public, and embellish it, with as much more advantage as to not be in continuous useless expenses to build.
It will be said that there are the riches of their sacristies. Surely, thanks to the piety of of the faithfuls these are considerable, however they have been made either with what the Religious have deprived themselves of, or with the small spontaneous contributions of the people, which certainly, since they {the people} were contributing their own money would have not thought about committing any iniquities, and would have, therefore, set a good example for others, so that they would imitate their piety, which certainly keeps the quietness and the good order in the Society, although it is a political (good).
I ask: Is a treasure and a public depository useful and necessary to all the Societies? Very useful without fault; and even more useful if it will be formed insensibly by the spontaneous and virtuous small contributions of many private {citizens}, and if it will made of that gold and that silver that otherwise would have been converted in many tablewares and in thousands others useless Manifactures, and if it will be more secure, and if will be more capable of enticing the people to convince them to grow it evermore. Therefore, the Ecclesiastic riches are useful, and they contribute to the political good of all Society.
General rule: *The greater the riches of a Nation's temples, the greater is the sign that such nation is constantly more and more powerful, governed and happier than the others*. And lets pass on to other things.
[A.] deplores that the idleness of the Religious *is venerated from the populace with stupid admiration*. I won't discourse here if all those that admire the perfection of the life of our Ecclesiastics are stupid, and plebs; I will rather say that the stupidity of a Man of letters that writes in such manner, is something more befitting for a senseless {one}; and I will add that those essays of [A.]  that refer to the virtuous life of the Religious catholics *with disdainful compassion* are such that to the truly wise people, they {the lifes} inspire something more magnanimous than disnainful compassion. In my life I have never found an honest man that badmouthed about the Religious, nor I have found a man that loved and that knew how to sympathize the flaws of the Ecclesiastics, which was not very honest or evil. Lastly [A.] has written that the Religious are *victims, thing that could be allowed, because they are in fact, without doubt, of the most generous and precious species. Since, however he makes use of that term for another meaning, I have to answer him according to his intelligence.
We have observed in all the sentiments and all the opinions of our Writer, that he has written his Book, not in favour of the good of the State, but only for the good of the Society, and, rather, he has upheld it even with detriment of the former, up until pretending that a private man has a greater right than the entirety of all Society, or of those that represent it. With such premise, I affirm that [A.] has falsely called *victims* the cloistered Religious, because it is certain that all of them, except a few vicious ones, are very pleased with their condition, so much that they wouldn't change it with that of the most powerful Sovereign of Earth, as we understand from their speeches, from the health that they enjoy, from the hilarity of their (incitations), from their standard of living as a whole. If it is certain, now, that in this World, those who are pleased with their condition are happy, then the Religious are happy; and if they are happy, why ever treat them as *victims*? Why not even congratulate them of such well being of which they possess? As it is not seeked other good from [A.] than the happines of the privates? If this is not {an example of} being opposed to oneself and his own sentiments and principles, what would it ever be? This kind of Man of letters, however, already possess the ability to contradict themselves in all their maxims and it is not possible for them to not end up like those who want to travel to unknown Countries, without guide, and make their way only for themselves as the ships do. With all of this, we will (have cure) to not loose sight of the lost traces of our [A.].


PAGES: 85-87

After that [A.], as we have noted, has vented his grudge against the Cloistered Religious, takes upon the examination of the punishments of *Exile*, the *Confiscations*, and the Spirit of *Family*; With everything out of place and without writing nothing new or good; and moreover, the written frenchisms that are found in those Articles make who reads more aware of the partiality that [A.] has for some Writers.
Slided over these matters he comes back to take his primary subject, that is to speak *of the sweetness of the Punishments*, and here he still rolls over in (all the ways) {many ways}, and climbs upon the most ruinous boulders and between the most lacerating thorns, in order to persuade his Readers that nobody should be condemned to death; and he discourses about such argument in a manner that who reads is forced to pity his paradoxes, and to keep observing him with that same eye of curiosity with which one would observe some hapless that inadvertedly falls into a lake, in the same (act) {moment} that he was striving to come out of a small river where he was incautiously fallen into. But one should not be disgusted in finding out his traitorous sophisms, his invisible subtleties, his fake concerns, his toruous cavils and his violent attractions.
~ Of sweetness of Punishments ~ The fundamental proposition that [A.] plants trying to prove the abolishment of the punishment of Death, is the following, that is that *One of the greatest (brake) {damper} of Crimes is not the cruelty of the punishments, but the infallibility of them* \(a\) ~\(a\) Pag. 58~; From that proposition it should be deduced that an (evil) man will abstain from committing a crime more if he will believe infallible that by commiting it, he will be condemned to stay locked up for a week for example in a comfortable prison then if will be a little bit debious whether that by commiting the same crime he will be burned alive. {It is} Worse, because [A.] should have reflected {upon the fact} that wicked men do not doubt, because if they will fall in the hands of justice, they will be inesorably condemned; they hope rather to never fall into them {into the justice}. Even worse: because many are seen passing (frankly) {without injure} a small rivulet upon a narrow and weak (timber); but if the water of this Rivulet is greatly increased and becomes very deep, then despite the timber is the same as before, nobody risks passing over it anymore. It is not the certainty, therefore, but the size of the evil and the danger, what makes men more cautious in acting.
It shall be noted that after the recently reported words, *One of the greatest dampers of Crimes* [A.] adds here immediately those {words} that follow. *And by consequence the vigilance of Magistrates, and that Severity of an insesorable Judge, that in order to be a useful virtue, it must be accompanied by a sweet legislation.* I can't grasp the sense of such consequence. Without doubt a printing error has happened, and maybe that *e* should bea a verb. Lets resume.

PAGES: 87-90

The atrocity of the punishments, the sole thinking of it (of) {as written by} [A.], not only is less effective than the infallability of the same for stemming the crimes, but moreover, as himself sustains, *the atrocity of the punishment itself, makes it so that it would be more desirable to avoid it the bigger the evil to which one goes against, and makes it so that more crimes are commited to escape the punishment of one*, very true, that *the atrocity of the punishment makes it to do and dare more to avoid it* \(as here he write, but [A.] (does not want to)\) And I ask for forgiveness that to avoid a great evil, bigger ones would be made, and that *to escape the punishment of once, more crimes would be wanted to be made*. (It is) {Is It} a great thing that certain (Thinkers) would want to gamble on a paradox rather than deprive themselves of the pleasure of a good (joke) {play} of words(?) [A.] wants to imitate his great President [di M.....] but if were true that men, to avoid the puinishment of one sole crime are willing to commit many others, then, if all punishments were abolished, all crimes would end. What an felicitious admirable finding!
To fully prove this paradox of his he says so: *The Countries and the times of the most atrocious tortures were always those of the most sanguineous and inhumane actions, because the same spirit of ferocity that guided the hand of the Legislator, held that of the Parricide and the Hit man.* This reflection, however, hits very little {doesn't pack a big hit}, because it was necessary to prove that the cause of those *sanguineous, and inhumane actions* has been the atrocity of the tortures and that it is not rather true the opposite. And anyway, one thing is a tirannic Government, another it is the pacific ones which are the ones with talk about here. Another paradox. To the following page he addes that *a measure that the more the tortures become cruel, the more humane tempers (get tougher)*; and consequently he therefore deduces that *the always living strength of the passions, makes it that after a hunder years of cruel tortures, the Whell scares as much as the (previous) imprisonment {that once was}. It is known which strength can earn how immaginations above certain objects; but that it can arrive to equally learn the fright of the Wheel, as the one of simple imprisonment, whoever affirms this abuses of the reason of his Readers.
It is true, then, that men are always ready to commit the biggest crimes to escape a punishment, everytime that they hope to make it with impunity; And what do this cases have to do with the truth that the fear of a greater punishment stems the crimes more than a lesser punishment? Onwards.
The two reported inconvenients of the atrocity of the punishments appear to be tenuous to [A.] because he says that these other two deadly consequences are derived from them, very much against to the end itself of preventing crimes. The first is \(a\) ~\(a\) Pag. 64~ *that it is not easy to retain the essential proportion between the Crime and the Punishment because albeit an industrious cruelty has many varied kinds, even than they can't exceed that last strength to which is limited the humane organization and sensibility. Once this extreme has been reached \([A.] continues\) more harmful and atrocious crimes with a corresponding great punishment wouldn't be found, as it would be necessary to prevent them.
The other consequence of his is the following: * that the same impunity is born from the atrocity of the crimes, because men are enclosed between certain limits, both in good and evil, and because a too atrocious show can't be but a passing furor.*
I (protest) here, of having transcribed these two consequences, called *baleful* by [A.] not for explain them as they deserve, but only because it is seen the use that he himself {the author} makes of his Metaphysic and of his geometric genius, in things of such seriousness. He would want that a graduated table was made, in two columns, in one of which could be written by order the different grades of guiltiness of each possible crime, and in the other the quality of the punishments that each crime deserves. Now, since according to [A.], the gravity and the atrocity of the crimes grows in an infinite series, it shall follow that we will sign in one part of the column of the Punishments, for example a little above its half *Punishment of Death*, and that in the column of the crimes it shall be found signed till the upper extremity of the same column of the crimes the different severities of the same crimes; It will follow, I was saying, in such supposition, that in this tablet, would remain signed a great number of different grades of atrocitiy of crimes, without any punishment that would correspond to them; and behold, *that it should not be kept the proportion essential between the Crimes and the Punishments* as [A.] imagines, from what he obtains that if it was let to assign to certain crimes the Punishment of Death, that is the extremity of death, one could then, divide, and grade the punishments in a way to make one column that would correspond exactly to that of the grades of the different atrocities of the Crimes.

PAGES: 90-92

Since, now, the fact that men could be able to find the infinite specific differences of the various grades of guiltiness of the Crimes and of various grades of the Punishment that each crime deserves is an impossible thing, we should stop castigating all wicked men until a great geometrician capable of grading with craved accuracy the Table of the Crimes and Punishments, as the geometric fantasy of [A.] has imagined it. What an abuse of the science of men!
The Judges, however, that haven't wanted to study the Analysis, have judged that such demonstrable geometric accuracies of the correspondence of the Punishments with the Crimes  matter very little to Societies, as long as it is achieved to purpose that men commit as less crimes as possible; Which they obtain, exactly, by giving the death penalty to many crimes, without which the World would be full of wicked man that would laugh at the graded tables of [A.].
After all, it is an evident thing, that even if the death penalty would be left out, the grading of the Punishments and the Crimes, would be even more difficult to execute in the system of [A.] than it would be in the ordinary one; or we will say, moreover, that even in his system, it would be necessary to correspond the Death penalty to those same crimes that it is given today by all the Nations; and then everything would depend upon seeing what would be the atrocity of a crime that deserved in the place of the first grade of the inferior rank of the column of the *Crimes* and what (would be) the first grade of punishment that was put likewise in the first place of the inferior rank of the Column of the Punishments; So, it could follow that facing the grade of the *Punishment of death* it would come to correspond a crime that deserved a punishment inferior of the one of Death. And here, new calculations would be necessary, and new metaphysicians and even a voluminous Dictionary of the Crimes and Punishments.
Moreover, if crimes should be punished with the rule that [A.] has given us to the page fifty nine, as much the Graded Tables, as the Dictionary of the Crimes and Punishments would be superfluous, because here it is how He thinks and writes about it. *For a punishment to obtain its effect, it is enough that the evil of the punishment exceeds the good that is born from the crime, and in this excess of evil it must be calculated the infallability of the punishment and the loss of the good that the crime would produce*. And he concludes: *that all the more, is superfluous and tyrannical*.
Since it is certain, now, that (at the end of the counts) {ultimately} no wicked man obtain any good from his crimes, nothing, therefore, should be punished. The punishments, and the crimes, however, are neither lines nor numbers capable of equations.
Nothing {to do?}: even that other proposition is more metaphysical: *that a show too atrocious is nothing but a passing furor*. According to [A.], therefore, for the reason of the contraries, the less the show will be atrocious, the greater would be the impression that it will have to make; unless it would be said that such show was infinitely faster in its running than the speed of the of the fastest lightning. Either the Author here hasn't spoken in his right (mind) {sense,judgement} or I would know what to say (to me) about this metaphysic of his, because he has both experience, and reason against him, and I can't help him in any way. Nontheless, almost like his said reason had persuaded and convinced the whole world he (gives into) this rigmarole, that it is clear which Court, and which persons it impiously removes out of sight.

~\(a\) Pag.6 Art.2.~ *Who, while reading history, will not shudder in horror for the barbaric and pointless torments that were invented with a cold heart from men that called themselves sages? Who cannot feel his most sensible parts quiver by seeing thousands of unfortunates that misery, either wanted, or tolerated by the Laws, that have always favored the few and offended the many, drew to a desperate return to the first state of nature, or accused of impossible crimes, and fabricated by the timid ignorance, or guilty of nothing but being faithful to their own principles, by men endowed with the same senses, and by consequence, with the same passions, with meditated formalities, and lacerated with slow tortures, a jocund spectacle of a fanatic Multitude?* As such, columniously, [A.] {writes?}.
It must be deduced from such above any measures empthatic text that [A.] imagines either that no one has read History except him or that everybody must believe anything his word proposes; As to me, I am persuaded to the opposite, that either that he has very little knowledge of History or that he hasn't done such study in nothing but the most suspicious Works of the Protestants, right in nothing but reporting with the most malignant minuteness and rabidly biting minimal flaws of us Catholics. The disgusting atrocity of his invective (and) having put it in a place not appriopriate to his subject, give me reason to form this judgement.
I said that his invective wasn't appropriate firstly because the question in which is searched for *If the punishments already established by the Laws are right or not?* with an invective so long and so researched, against the cruelty that Courts of many centuries ago could have used; and also because that Invective is thrown entirely against a single Court of the world, and exactly against the one that has never committed cruelty of such kind.
And the fact that [A.] hasn't had much inclination towards the deep studies of History, or that he writes as if he has never applied himself to similar studis in the good Books, is proven to me by all the expressions that can be read in that Invective, because the men that are supposed to be condemned to die barbarically from the Ecclesiastical Courts are either those that were condemned as Heretics or those that have died in the Religious Wars. Lets suppose here for a moment, in favour of [A.] that truly the Superior Ecclesiastics of Catholicism those that have condemned the Heretics to flames, and they have been equally those that have caused and wanted the death of all those victims that have been sacrified to the Religious Wars as it has already been said. Now:
1. We know by the most exact historical Records, that the condemned to the flames for reason of Heresy don't (arrive ) {reach} to make the number of four thousands, and it should be considered that among those condemned as Heretics, the greater part, and little less than all of them were convicted criminals, of Deism, Pantheism, Atheism, of sacrilege, of Sedition, of Rebellion, and of other enormous crimes against the Society and against the State.
2. The number of those that have died in the Religious Wars, by very rigorous calculations, arrive to make the number of six millions, including the Wars of the East.
3. It is not possible to relieve the precise number of those that have been sentenced to death within the space of ten Centuries, by the Sovereigns of all Europe; with all this, proceeding by approximation, and giving that there have been executed only one thousand year by year, it would be a total of a million of convicts.
4. Given that in the Wars made by the Christian Princes of Europe in the space of ten Centuries has died in each decade, a million men, in ten Centuries, the number of deaths in the political Wars would be of a hundred millions. For me, nevertheless, it would be sufficient that of just 50,000,000 {50 millions}.
5. Therefore, according to the aforementioned calculation, the number of convicts from the Catholic Church as Heretics in eighteen centuries stands 4,000 to 1,000,000 to the number of convicts from the European Christian Princes as villains. And the number of {men} murdered in the Wars of Religion stands 6,000,000 to 50,000,000 to the number of {men} killed in the Political Wars. Namely as six millions to fifty millions; that is, even in lower relation, 1 to 8.
Having made and observed this small historical-political calculation, I return to read again that Invective by [A.] against the cruelty of which he accuses of guiltiness the Catholic Church; full, however, of bitter confusion for who has wanted to write it, I am surprised by how a man of Letters such as is nonetheless [A.], and whom very often appeals, and with much pride, to the testimony of History, targets in his very cruel Invective, only the *Sages* of the Catholic Church, that have, as it is supposed, condemnted to death a small number of men, compared to that one that have done the Sovereigns of the Century. If such kind of Invective can be called opportune in that place where it been squeezed, and added without necessity, why, therefore, lash out in such an unworthy manner solely against the few claimed cruelties of the Ecclesiastics, and not inveigh equally against the very many {cruelties} of others? And hasn't this been a {statement/act} to want the entire world to pay for what his heart is full of?
