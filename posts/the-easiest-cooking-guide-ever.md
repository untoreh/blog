Let's divide cooking in a four steps and analyze each one of them:

- Cleaning
- Mixing
- Heating
- Resting

# Cleaning
#### Buying
In the first step we also consider the process of _acquiring_ the ingredients. Discount stores are nice because of wider offerings, you can work around the shorter shelf life by _freezing_ anything that you don't intend to use right away.

#### Storage and preparation
Let's consider some groups with some tips:
- Fruits and veggies:
  Soaking in water/vinegar for at least *half an hour* can help the cleaning process, if they are full of dirt. It can also help *re-hydratiation*, although it this case we are talking about at least half a day of soaking (and never more than 48 hours, because bacteria).
  For veggies you can use almost the whole thing, but usually we throw away the harder parts that take too long to cook, but if you separate the harder parts, you can *blend* them and cook them separately (to make, soup or spices, or creams).
  Fruits peels are so and so, as a rule-of-thumb, peels with scales should be thrown, the smoother the skin the more likely it is (thoughroully) cleanable and edible, except for bananas. Don't use citrus fruits peel unless stated to be biological. Not all fruit peels are nice, some are toxic by nature, like ananas, although you can argument that quantities matter. (_i.e._ there exist a liquor made from apple seeds, despite seeds of any fruit from the _rosacea_ family of plants containing a small dose of cyanide).
- Legumes: 
  Dried legumes need a couple of washing, since they can collect dust and other particles during storage. Take care of storage places, many kinds of bugs can feed on them, use _rigid_ storage boxes, not bags.
  The washing amount depends on how **thick** the legume's shell is. Legumes classificated as beans and chickpeas need a good 24 hours, smaller legumes like lentils are fine with a couple of hours.
- Powders:
  Like flour and sugars. If the storage place is not dry enough, you might need to **sift** the powder to break down the cluster that have formed because of _humidity_. Bugs like moths are also bad for flour, use good storage.

#### Cutting
You can cut with knives, but there are many cheap tools that you can buy that help reducing vegetables and fruits into slices, or mashing into rough or fine powders. They either use some spring mechanism, or have a shape fit for some particular fruits/veggies.

#### Eggs
Eggs have a wide adoption in cooking, they are used as:
- emulsifiers (keep things together in an smooth liquid form)
- binders (keep things together in a solid form)
- leaveners (can trap air and give rise to doughes)
Eggs are made from yolk (fats) and white (proteins and water). The white is mostly useful for binding/leavening solids, the yolk for emulsifying creams, or for garnishing. 
Remembering these facts, choose how to use eggs, and use an _egg separator_ to optional use yolk and whites as different ingredients.
When beating eggs, warming them (no more than 30C) and adding a couple drops of lemon juice (or citric acid) can help the mounting process.

# Mixing
During mixing we try to give the right _shape_ and _consistency_ to our subject.

#### Order
Usually you want to mix by groups, solids with solids, and liquids with liquids. By solids we mean _powder_ like ingredients, and by liquid anything that doesn't hold its shape. Unless you want air, in which case you mix sugar with butter.

#### Cold or Hot?
If you are making a cake you want butter to be melted first _before_ mixing, if you are making ice cream, you want pieces in ice cubes that _will be blended_ together. If you are blending almonds and sugar to make nougat, you want them to be cold to _avoid caramelization_ of sugars, which would prevent paste formation.

#### Time
Sometimes it is important to pay attention to the duration of the mixing process. Making a dough for tarts you want it to be short, to _prevent development of gluten bonds,_ which would give rigidity to the baked cake. Mixing too much liquids that already holds air (like beaten eggs or butter/sugar mix) breaks the air bubbles and lets all the air **escape** the batter. On the contrary when mixing a dough for bread, you want to give the mixing process enough time to allow gluten bonds to form to give **elasticity** to the dough which is important afterwards to shape the bread and give it mechanical strength to _rise_ during the backing process.

#### Quantities
Adding all the fats at once, like oil, can make a dough _loose_ its consistency, breaking it down in smaller pieces. You want to gradually add fats to _balance_ **gluten creation** with **fat absorption**. In the same way add ingredients like water or milk all at once is not a good idea. It is easier to work with a dough where solids and liquids are gradually mixed, and it helps _spot errors_ in **dosages** sooner rather than later. 
Different ingredients have different water contents. You can find out how much water an ingredient has by checking the nutritional facts and then **subtracting** from the total (usually `100g`), the _sum of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates_. The weight of minerals and vitamins is negligible.
Total water contents are important to avoid a dough from becoming a batter and viceversa. Some ingredients (like potatoes, and blended fruits/veggies in general) can hold more water, because fibers prevent other ingredients like flour from absorbing too much water, however the resulting dough still ends up stickier and is harder to handle.

#### Leavening agents
- Chemical leavening: sodium/potassium bicarbonate or _baking powder_, to be added at the **end** of the mixing process, prefer quick mixing.
- Organic leavening: **yeasts** from beer, or yogurt, or in dried (powder) form. To be added **gradually** during the mixing process. 
  - Leavening agents work better with temperatures _higher_ than **20C** and _less_ than **30C**. 
  - Fermentation continues as long as temperatures are above 0, _slows down_ with too _low temperatures_ and too _high temperatures_. Use the fridge and the oven (light) to _regulate_ how much time to dedicated to fermentation.
  - **High humidity** is important for development of yeasts. A glass of water close to the dough can help (and keep them in an enclosed environment to _trap humidity_, or cover with a cloth)
  - a little bit of additional sugar _can help_ the fermentation process, but usually grains from the dough already have enough sugar
  - **Salt** can _slow down_ fermentation, and too much salt can kill yeasts altogether.
  - The fermentation process converts sugars into proteins, carbon dioxide and acids. Too much fermentation and the dough will spoil. As a rule of thumb, **2 days** for doughs kept at _room temperature_, **2 weeks** for doughs kept in the _fridge_.
- Mechanical leavening: _beated eggs_, _creamed butter_, _blended fruit_. These ingredients are able to _trap air_ and therefore give rise when mixed within the dough during baking as the air tries to _escape_ from the bubbles.

# Heating
- **Maillard reaction**: Proteins, fats and sugars combining among themselves into more complex molecules. This is what gives flavors when cooking. It increases with higher temperatures and lower water contents (up until to burn out), so it is much more prominent on the _surface_ of the cooked thing. It follows that if you _cut_ things in smaller pieces, therefore _increasing the surface area_ you will end up with more flavor (there might exist a thing as too much flavor though). Its releveant when baking, toasting, roasting and frying, all cooking methods with low or no water contents.
- **Caramelization**: when sugar mixes with water at high temperature, as the reaction continues, water evaporates and sugars burns away becoming more bitter. Caramelization helps giving food a more rigid, crunchy crust.
