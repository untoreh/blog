Every branch will eventually become fertile by sprouting newer branches on their tips. Sprouting happens in spring and autumn, which are usually the periods with higher humidity, and tends to align with pruning periods, which makes the choice of the time of pruning also important.</p> <ul> <li><p>At what time of the year should tree be pruned? Olive trees slow down in winter and summer &#40;because of drought&#41;, which makes these the ideal times for pruning. However in summer pruning branches bearing fruits is not ideal even if not damaging for the tree itself. Since plants break dormancy after ~11° The ideal time to prune &#40;or at least make the most decisive cuts&#41; is in late winter &#40;such that open wounds won&#39;t be affected by harsh frosts&#41;, early spring &#40;before the tree starts to choose how many resources to reserve for frutification&#41;.</p> </ul> </ul> <h2 id=height ><a href="#height" class=header-anchor >Height</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>cutting the peaks that are too high &#40;always leave the edge&#41; <img alt=olives_height  src="/assets/posts/img/olives_height.jpg" style="float: none; padding: 0.5rem; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; "></p> <ul> <li><p>The maximum desired height of the tree depends on the length of the ladder you use for pruning &#40;if you use the ladder&#41;, or the length of your telescopic tools &#40;if you don&#39;t use the ladder.&#41;</p> </ul> </ul> <h2 id=fungi ><a href="#fungi" class=header-anchor >Fungi</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>dig out rotten wood caused by <a href="https://www.coltivazionebiologica.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Carie-albero-di-olivo-radici-e1606129520503.jpg">fungi attacks</a> at the base or on the branches with a chainsaw or an hatchet.</p> </ul> <h2 id=how_to_perform_cuts ><a href="#how_to_perform_cuts" class=header-anchor >How to perform cuts</a></h2> <p>When you prune, any choice boils down to performing cuts, the way you make them influences the tree, and since you can average hundreds of cuts per tree, all of them stack up. These rules are applicable to any tree in general, and not just olive trees.</p> <ul> <li><p>The bigger the cuts, the more weight these rules carry, as a rule of thumb:</p> <ul> <li><p>less than <code>1cm</code> are inconsequential</p> <li><p>more than <code>2cm</code> things start to matter</p> <li><p>Remember that the area is a quadratic function, which means that the effects of increasing differences in the area <em>also</em> grow as a power of two.</p> </ul> <li><p>How much to leave? Leaving too much results in a <strong>stump</strong> &#40;and possibly enticing the plant to sprout more smaller branches on the stump with the goal to restore the flux of sap, which will result in the formation of annoying to prune bush-like branches&#41;, leaving to little will form <strong>holes</strong> in the bark &#40;holes are bad, they leave the inner sap flow more exposed to externalities, and allow water to <em>stagnate</em>, forming an ideal habitat for antagonistic phytophagous fungi&#41;.</p> <ul> <li><p>Since most of the cuts will involve cutting suckers, which have an age of 1-3 years &#40;or more generally an age less than or equal to the pruning frequency&#41;, it is easier to differentiate the <em>younger</em> bark of the shoots, from the <em>older</em> one of the main branches, the cut should be performed at this boundary, such that all the young bark of the shoot is cut out, and no old bark is removed. <img alt=olives_cut1  src="/assets/posts/img/olives_cut1.jpg" style="float: none; padding: 0.5rem; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; "></p> <li><p>If the branches are older, and the age difference of the bark is not easy to spot &#40;at the boundary they both look old&#41;, another clue which aids the cut is the cone-like shape of the branch to be cut. Usually the boundary between the branches is not a rigid angle, instead it resembles a graceful curve. Considering the vertical section, the cut will be performed when the two parallel lines of the branch will cross inwards into the bark. <img alt=olives_cut2  src="/assets/posts/img/olives_cut2.jpg" style="float: none; padding: 0.5rem; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; "></p> <li><p>The direction of the cut in general has to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality">orthogonal</a> to the direction towards which the branch to be cut is growing. Performing cuts this way ensures that they are as small as possible because &#40;considering the horizontal section&#41; the cut is closer to a circle and further from an ellipse, since given the radius of a circle, and assumed that the minimum radius of the ellipse is the same as the circle, the area of the ellipse will be always above or equal to the area of the circle. All in all, it means smaller cuts lead to smaller wounds, which leads to faster healing and a lower probability of diseases. <img alt=olives_cut3  src="/assets/posts/img/olives_cut3.jpg" style="float: none; padding: 0.5rem; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; "></p> <ul> <li><p>There is an exception though, when cuts will end up facing upwards, it is preferrable to make them slightly oblique; this allows rain to slide down like it would from a roof, instead of inesorably digging holes in the wound left by the cut.</p> </ul> <li><p>Younger branches are more fibrous, older ones are more ligneous. What this means is that left-overs from younger branches will <em>more likely</em> dry up. Since fibers are more porous, they are more susceptible to wind and sun compared to denser older ligneous branches. Also the thicker bark of older branchs prevents humidity from escaping.</p> </ul> <li><p>Prune one &#40;of the 4&#41; angle at a time, starting from the top and descending towards the base.</p> <ul> <li><p>Unless you plan on cutting tertiary branches that have grown downwards too much, in which case you start from those, and then will procede as normal, top to bottom &#40;although with less intrusive cuts since you just performed a big cut at the base.&#41; <img alt=olives_branches  src="/assets/posts/img/olives_branches.jpg" style="float: none; padding: 0.5rem; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; "></p> </ul> </ul> <h2 id=soil_fertilizers_water_and_fruits ><a href="#soil_fertilizers_water_and_fruits" class=header-anchor >Soil, Fertilizers, water and fruits</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>Olive trees need lots of nitrogen, because they have to always replace their foliage. &#40;For a more detailed breakdown of all the minerals <a href="https://accademiaolivoeolio.com/img2/file/palese-et-al-esigenze-minerali-e-tecniche-di-concimazione_201804061101921_9c1pcptsi5mnhw9ivqw4d800z.pdf">look at this paper</a>&#41;</p> <li><p>As in most plantation you want a mix of soluble and organic &#40;slow transfer&#41; fertilizers</p> <li><p>Water is important in spring, before and during flowers blossoming, to aid frutification; neglecting to do so in a dry spring, will cause most of the small fruits to fall before reaching summer.</p> <li><p>Water is also important during summer, not for the fruit quality, but still important for the plant and the harvesting period. Since the mechanical way to harvest olives is through tree shaking, a weak tree subject to such stress will loose also too much of its foliage, therefore it is important to make sure trees have a tight canopy before the harvest. Summer irrigation also makes fruits grow rounder &#40;and slightly bigger, although olives size is dependant on the cultivated variety&#41;</p> <li><p>Some people say that watering olive trees during summer leads to a higher yield of olives, but not an higher yield of olive oil and make oil extraction harder &#40;as machines have to separate more water from the oil&#41;. In my experience this is not true.</p> <ul> <li><p>Olives coming from trees irrigated throughout summer are first and foremost healthier. Healthy olives have an higher yield, the skin has less chance of breaking and preserves more substances inside the pulp. Both the seeds and the pulp are bigger, and since olives <em>are not grapes</em> <sup id="fnref:berries"><a href="#fndef:berries" class=fnref >[1]</a></sup>, necessarily they will have more oil. <table class=fndef  id="fndef:berries"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:berries">[1]</a> <td class=fndef-content >Berrie like fruits are able to store higher water contents without enlarging the fruit itself, like <em>bags</em>. This is not true for drupes. </table> </p> </ul> <li><p>The roots need oxygen, a porous soil is ideal, and allows the roots to expand without risking asphyxiation. Porous rocks mixed with the soil can be helpful to keep the soil aerated, without resorting to plowing.</p> <li><p>Trichoderma and mycorrhizae help against wood rotting, which should be spread in the soil as close as possible to the roots. Despite these treatments having no <em>healing</em> properties &#40;they are a form of prevention&#41;, they can be considered a treatment in the case of olive trees because of their perennial nature, their average strong vigor and their natural ability to <em>marginalize</em> phytophagic fungi. In other words, since olive trees &quot;heal themselves&quot;, trichoderma and mycorrhizae can be considered healing <em>boosters</em>.</p> <li><p>Plowing, tilling or grass? It depends on the type of soil and average weather, however:</p> <ul> <li><p>because olive tree roots don&#39;t usually grow deeper than 1 meter, tilling is preferred to plowing. Olive trees tend to also grow on <em>rocky</em> soils, where not even tilling is possible, and soil operations are reduced to mowing. Plowing and tilling works better when using herbicides to control weeds growth, whereas without herbicide mowing helps to preserve the bacterial ecosystem of the soil. When choosing to mow, controlling the type of herbs left over can be beneficial, like for examplke opting for drought resistant grass. The main advantage of plowing/tilling is deeper oxygenation, grass on the other hand helps against soil erotion, decomposition of soil nutrients, droughts &#40;through higher water retention&#41;. It is also common to cover the soil by an 80&#37; with breach, in which cases only tilling is applied on top.</p> </ul> </ul> <h2 id=conclusion ><a href="#conclusion" class=header-anchor >Conclusion</a></h2> <p>Olive trees are very resilient plants, but are <em>light seekers</em> . Overall it is easy to grow olive trees where there is a lot of sun and just enough water. The plants have natural methods to stem off diseases, and require attention against only 3 major pathologies &#40;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spilocaea_oleaginea">spots</a>, <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora">rot</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_fruit_fly">fly</a>&#41;, while the rest can be considered minor. But it doesn&#39;t like harsh climates, it doesn&#39;t tolerate well temperatures below 0° and above 30°, too wet climates and too dry climates. Although growing olive trees is possible across a wide range of latitudes, it is only economically viable in subtropical regions.</p> <h4 id=fun_fact ><a href="#fun_fact" class=header-anchor >fun fact</a></h4> <p>It was thought that growing <em>cereals</em> among olive trees was bad because the light reflecting properties of the ears would stress out the olive trees and therefore <em>legumes</em> were preferred. Legumes do indeed produce more <em>nitrogen</em>, which olive trees crave &#40;on average more than other plants&#41;.</p> <p></p> <div id=post-tags-list > Post Tags: <span class=post-tag ><a href="/posts/tag/agri" style=""> agri </a>, </span> <span class=post-tag ><a href="/posts/tag/guides" style=""> guides </a></span></div> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > July 15, 2021 </div> <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="untoreh/untoreh.github.io" issue-term=pathname  label=Comment  crossorigin=anonymous  async> </script> </div> </div><div class=page__footer > <footer> <div class=page__footer-copyright > © untoreh - Powered by <a href= "https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin</a> </div> <div class=page__footer-links > - <ul> <li> <a href="/sitemap.xml">Sitemap</a> | <li> <a href="/tag">Tags</a> | <li> <a href="/feed.xml">RSS</a> </ul> </div> <ul class=author__wrap > <li class="author__urls social-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/untoreh" rel= "nofollow noopener noreferrer"><i class= "fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square" aria-hidden=true ></i></a> <li class="author__urls social-icons"> <a href="https://github.com/untoreh" rel= "nofollow noopener noreferrer"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-github" aria-hidden=true ></i></a> <li class="author__urls social-icons"> <a href="mailto:contact@unto.re"><i class= "fas fa-envelope"></i></a> <li class="author__place hvr-buzz-out"><script type="application/ld+json">{"homeLocation":{"addressCountry":"IT","addressRegion":"Apulia","@type":"https://schema.org/Place"}}</script> <div class="author__bio .hvr-bubble-float-top"> I am Francesco Giannelli.
