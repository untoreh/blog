When you quantify things, usually there is a curve, that tells you how much you need. This can generally be plotted such that you can extrapolate an ideal tipping point.

Every item in this database would have to have:
- a definition for _x_ and _y_ axes
- a _minimum_ and  _maximum_ for each axes
- a function to plot the curve (either mathematical or already implemented in a prog. lang.)
