Paying 500 euros to the dentist is not nice. Before I used to brush my teeth once or twice per day (sometimes I neglected the evenings because sleep...), but considering I got __6__ intra-teeth cavities, apparently is not enough. So, here is my new schedule for keeping a tighter oral hygiene:

- Take a vitamin pill every couple days (even though those have daily doses). Vitamin pills also contain minerals so they should help with teeth decay. (10€/year)
- Use a more powerful electric toothbrush, I was using a 4000rpm, while now I got a 30000rpm one, newer ones have a more stable vibrating pattern that I assume it is important to reach spots between teeths and between teeths and gums. (30€/once)
- Use two different toothpastes, in the morning use one for protection (with biomimetics/fluoride/olaflur/etc.. as active principle) and in the evening use an antiseptic one (mouthwash-based/herbs). (2€/toothpaste)
- Because flossing can be too time consuming, I opted for using an ultra sonic cleaner every few weeks to thoroughly clean tartar between teeth. I got one that also has a camera and light to see where tartars accumulates, make sure it is __actually__ an ultra sonic cleaner, such that it uses sound waves instead of vibrations (Some cleaner are marketed as being ultra sonic, but use vibrations...); The ones that use vibration can damage the teeth. (30€/once)
- Use mouthwash at least for a couple of days after using the ultra sonic cleaner.

Hopefully this will help avoid hard to swallow dentist parcels in the future :|
