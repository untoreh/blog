I haven't found any commercially distributed type of jar with a _double bottom_ such that yogurt can be put from the top, with a _cheese cloth_ like bottom, that strains the yogurt, such that whey can be effortlessly be removed from the bottom of the jar, without the need for an additional decanting step.
