There is an underlying problem with markets: they are limited by human psyche. What does it mean? Essentially that the pricing ability for a particular asset, is bounded by the collective ability to grasp long term consequences. 
The problem is that because we are animals, most of the times we feel pressure only for things _close to us_ both in space and time. If we assume this to always be true we can list the most evident examples where this tendency brings failure:

## Wealth distribution
It is understandable how things like [_quantitative easing_] might look like an effective solution in times of crisis, but plotted on a longer than human-life timeline, things might look different, when _chickens have come home to roost_, inflation hits, and the weaker parts of society take the hit the most. The problem is that by the time the effect is felt (_why did this thing doubled in price?_), the catalyst (a.k.a. big monetary injection) has passed the news, and the population, drowning in their everyday affairs (_I can't be late for work or I'll get fired, I can't get fired, especially now, that bills and taxes have become so prohibitive_), does not respond _as it should_; Causes and effects are edulcorated (_which year-span caused the crisis? 1980? 1990? 2000?_), targeting _the issue_ becomes an unsurmountable coordination problem, as _more imminent_ issues closer to the space-time of society take precedence (_we need to fix unemployment now, the economy later..._).

## Scarcity of resources
When I buy a shovel, I have a price in mind, that is made of the parts that compose the shovel. The handle and the tip. Prices tend to include _extraction costs_ applied to the cost of raw materials, then we find _build costs_, _storage costs_, _transportation costs_, _service costs_. We cut the pricing here, (ignoring taxes). Rarely _disposal costs_, _pollution costs_... are priced in.

## Social effects
How does something modifies society? There are products like _smartphones_ that permanently change the shape of society and generations to come, yet factoring such costs is _not a thing_. Every tool that we make changes our way of living, and circularly the path that progress takes in its quest to improve our life [^1].

### Conclusion
There is a common trend here, things that are hard to quantify are left unquantified. This goes against the saying _something is better than nothing_. Leaving things unquantified is almost the same as denying that they exist, when we follow this pattern for a prolonged amount of time, we eventually forget, right until the problem is too big to ignore (_the rug in our home formed a somewhat mountainous shape!_).
Pricing things, even wrongly is better than freeloading, because we need to be constantly reminded that problems exist.
