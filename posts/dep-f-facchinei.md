[This] is a _partial_ translation of `Note ed osservazioni sul libro intitolato Dei delitti e delle pene` by  [Ferdinando Facchinei].

I kept translating until the one who commissioned the translation decided to stop. Most likely because as the translation progressed, it became apparent how much wrong the author of the observations was!

The author himself was also not very proud of this work, and did not like how it made him (in)famous, it was not his brightest work. You can find more on this [short biography].
