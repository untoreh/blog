Many video game genres are built around a pool of characters that tends to grow indefinitely with the game itself. Character development can make use of a tool that is able to visualize properties like _affinities_, _oppositions_, _complements_ and so on by stacking multiple character profiles upon each other.

Such frame-work can be very useful both in modifying existing heroes and creating new ones, as it allows to _spot holes_ or deficiencies in particular properties sets, make the whole process of character development more stable in the long run.
