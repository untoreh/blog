- The spectator ui should have a 50% of the game always visible. This means _game camera_.
- lingering information is important, to give time to read game-wise important concept, and to ease-in spectators new to the game. In this regard, the [dota 2 tooltips] twitch extension makes lingering information less important, as the interactivity of information becomes more approachable.
- events timelines: at any given moment throughout the unfolding of a match, it has to be possible to gauge the current _stage_ of the game. Is the game beginning? at its peak momentum? is it ending? This should usually me _more than a clock_ and instead include important _milestones_ that decide the outcome of a match.
