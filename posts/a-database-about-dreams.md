Dreams catalysts are still unclear. They mean different things to many people.

My view is quite boring; I think dreams are made to keep you sleeping, because you need rest. If you think that a brain that doesn't know what to do, wants to wake up, to keep it quiet you give him something to do...therefore dreams.
When you are tired you don't dream. This follows, as the brain doesn't need something to do, because it is already exhausted, so it shuts off.

So why are dreams interesting? Because they take cues from surrounding, which means that even if they start from a fairly normal plot, they branch off into weird situations because of externalities (usually sounds). 

They are also used to "elaborate", because our mind processes in the background things we learn, as part of the learning process.
