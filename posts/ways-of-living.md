This can be defined as a spectrum between builders (settlers) and travelers (nomads).

Builders prefer to be stationary and to _accumulate_ value in its most lasting form, they look for systems and form specialized connections. They enjoy discovery through *experimentation*.

Travelers prefer not to be stationary and to _experience_ value in its most volatile form, they look for paths, and form broader connections. They enjoy discovery through _exploration_.
