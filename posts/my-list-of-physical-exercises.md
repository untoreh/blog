### Start
- Running on place. Ensure legs are aligned with the body, don't let calves stick out. Running on place is a quick way to increase blood flow and oxygenation, so I usually start with these (2-5min).
- Push-ups. Because push ups are a very static exercise, with high strength requirements and consume a lot of energy, so it is better to do them in the first part of a session. They are great to warm up your body, I like doing them in winter, not so much in summer...
- Stretching. There are many small movements that you can do to work on every part of your body. After all, the body has [all kinds of muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle).

The ones that I do are somewhat "yoga-like" but I don't follow anything in particular (number is the number of times every exercise is done, minimum or maximum depending by personal choice):

### Up and Down
- From standing up, reach for your feet with your hands (don't stress). (5-15)
- From standing up, reach for your knees with your hands. (5-15)

### Round and about
With your hands crossed, your arms stretched and your legs squatting, make a full circle clockwise and counter-clockwise. (3-9)

### Elbows on the side
- Hands crossed behind your head, such that your elbows stick on your right and left sides, torque your body first left and then right. (5-15)
- With the arms stretched horizontally on your sides, torque your body first left and then right. (5-15)

### Hands and shoulders
- With your hands touch your shoulders, both left and right, rotate your elbows clockwise and then counter-clockwise. (10-30)
- Starting with your hands on your shoulders, stretch your arms, one at a time and then touch your shoulder again, alternating left and right. (10-30)

### Legs squared
leaning on one side, stretch the outer leg sliding the heel until your foot faces almost upward. The inner leg assumes a straight angle position, with the knee almost touching the ground and the heel elevated from the ground (don't stress). (2-6)

### On a soft mat
Exercises below should be done on a soft surface.

### Reversed Pendulum
With one knee touching the ground, hands crossed behind your head, torque your body such that the elbow gets closer to the knee touching the ground, (don't stress). (3-6)

### Bridge
- Supine, with Hands crossed behind your head, legs crunched, with knees facing upwards, lift your back for a couple of seconds and go back again (15-45).
- Do the same bridge except keep your back lifted for longer (at least 10 seconds) (3-9).

### Heaps
- Legs stretched, use one elbow to lean on one side, with the arm assuming a straight angle position. Lift your heaps upwards for a couple of seconds and go back down. (10-30)
- Do the same on the other side (with the other elbow). (10-30)
- Instead of using elbows now you the palm of one of your hand to stand on one side, the angle between the your arm and your chest should be almost straight, such to form a letter "T". Keep still for at least 30 seconds. (1-3)
- do the same on the other side (with the other palm). (1-3)

### Legs and thighs
- Prone, use both your elbows to keep your chest above ground, head facing in front. Lift your legs upwards, one at a time, keeping them straight, as much as you can, for at least 30 seconds (one leg at a time). (10-30)
- Similar to the previous one, but instead of keeping the legs stretched, keep them crunched such that you can almost reach your head with your heel (one leg at a time) (don't stress).
- With the same elbows position, lift one of your legs slightly above your butt while keeping it stretched, and then crunch it. While keeping the leg lifted repeat stretching and crunching. (one leg at a time) (10-30)

### Abdominal
- Prone, with hands behind your head, while keeping legs stretched and firm, lift your chest upward. (20-60)
- Supine, with hands behind your head, while keeping legs stretched and firm, lift your chest upward, touching with one of your elbow the opposite knee. (20-60)
- Supine, with hands behind your head. Starting with legs stretched, lift them at the same time and crunch them to your chest. (10-30)
- Supine, with hands behind your head, or arms stretched and on the ground, lift both your legs towards one side (slightly on the left or on the right), while keeping them stretched. Lift until your legs and your upper body form a straight angle (don't stress). (3-9)
- Supine, with hands behind your head legs half-way crunched toward your chest, lift your chest and reach with one elbow the opposite knee alternating elbows and knees.

## Conclusions
The order that I have written is the one I use during a session, however I might end a session with some aerobic (after the abdominal exercises), usually you want to end with some stretching, so in this case my habits should not be recommended. The whole session generally last around half an hour, rarely 45 minutes.

Remember that physical exercises help with mood, blood pressure, constipation, dizziness due to low oxygenation and other things...so they are quite important and a good alternative to other types of more direct medications. 

Prefer exercises instead of pills when you can.
