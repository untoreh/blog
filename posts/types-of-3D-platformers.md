A 3D platformer is a type of game where you have a camera and the main objective is _going from point A to B_.

## Common features
- **checkpoints**: every level is filled with checkpoints, platforming is a matter of executing a sequence of actions (inputs), errors are common, and the outcome is usually _game over_. Checkpoints alleviates the most common pain point of platformers..._starting from scratch_.
- **speedruns**: platformers are the most common games to speed run, because they require precision in every step, they are similar to playing a musical instrument, where if you fail to execute the correct combinations, the outcome is _unpleasant_.
- **maps and addons**: there is a wide variety of maps as maps are the main _content_ of the game, communities are also fostered to build and experiment with different maps layouts and types of obstacles within them.
- **multiplayer and competition**: competition is both present in the form of _leaderboards_ and PvP _race style_ matches. However, because of the higher skill ceiling, and the common risk of failure within execution, leaderboards are the main gateway for competition.

## Sub categories
Platformers can be divided based upon what kind of physics they use to excert movement:
- **Surfers**: gliding, drifting, ramps and slopes control the direction of the PG, which is usually in constant movement from start to finish, fast paced.
- **Grapplers**: utilize projectiles, angular momentum and climbing to move across platforms, maps are usually made of binary checkpointed steps, where every step is a sequence of actions; because of this, the movement of the PG is slow paced with frequent interrupts. It is common to find puzzles within grapplers.
- **Parkour**: double-jumps, bunny-hopping, air-control, rocket-jumps are common abilities given to PGs in these kind of platformers. It is generally common to mix [FPS] elements with parkour elements with the objective of exploiting _weapons_ to overcome _obstacles_.
