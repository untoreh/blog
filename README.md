# Untoreh's website

The website can be divided in four parts

- Posts
- round up of previous projects

# Notes
- Translation doesn't edit LDJ data, it just addes the ldj markup mentioning that the page is translated.
- RSS feeds don't have translations.
- AMP pages are generated for main website and for the translations.
- TurboPages feeds need to be checked in case new ones have to be added to the WM dashboard

## Writing a blog post
Offline scripts used to generate content should be placed in the toplevel `/scripts` folder.
