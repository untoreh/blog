It might be possible that force pushing this way is not something github likes very much and could have been a cause for accounts getting flagged. The tagger function tasked with force pushing a different commits, uses a website (which you can lookup quite easily) that gives some randomized commits. I am not sure how much this helps, since the content itself of the commits is obviously suspicious for my case. And it also bit me in the ass once, since the commits returned by this command can include swear words, one of my commits was picked up by a twitter bot that tracks git commits with swear words! I added a blacklist for bad words after the incident.

I haven't really delved into obfuscated git commits and obfuscated git repositories.
The only instance where I was using a more elaborate repository was with Bitrise since you could not setup a build if the system did not recognize an environment (like mobile apps), but even then there wasn't any rotation and it was always the same repository, quite easy to spot.

Overall, if I had to plot a bell curve around the optimal time to mine _without_ getting accounts banned, across all the tested services, would be with a center around 1 hour build duration, once per day. For cpu cores, apart for a couple out-liars (like drone), most services expect you use the full amount of resources given to you since builds are run inside VMs or containers with constrained resources...and compilation is usually a task that saturates cpu, so it does not have statistical relevance.
Intuitively one build per day is what the average developer would do, so you should expect raised flags if you stray away from the mean, and pushing for abuse never ends well.

## Conclusions

Was it worth it? The networking parts were definitely interesting, dealing with accounts registrations was obviously the worst part, nobodies likes to click endless confirmation emails and repeating mind numbing UI procedures, after all. Writing spam automation software is also boring (because your mostly poking at dumb APis), and with this assumption (and the fact that this was never anything serious) I never even considered it.
Was it profitable? At its peak it was reaching something like `300$` per month, maybe enough for a venezuelan, not really for me :)

[^adversary]: _the grumpy sysadmin_
[^infoproc]: even though this would break many privacy assumptions, I am sure most of them just peek inside whenever there is a incumbent problem, but this is only a problem for container based runtimes, whereas VMs are pretty much black boxes.
[^monerominer]: the miner built into the monero node got some work to make it more background friendly, but the distribution of xmrig was never focused on background friendliness.
[^difficulty]: some pools offer different difficulties on different connection ports, and tend to align the job difficulty to the miner submitted shares, but the granularity of the proxy was still more convenient, as it would prevent pool [lock-in] \(although we never really switched pools \).
[^configwatch]: it wasn't happy when the config suddenly appeared and disappeared from the file system
[^stratumprotocol]: We don't talk about the [stratum protocol] since we just have to deal with whatever is implemented in _both_ the pool and the miner...which is usually the bare minimum, and possibly with non standard extensions.
[^fullbash]: never go full bash :\)
[^memoryondemand]: I have not explored what happens when a processes loads additional functionality at runtime, as the kernel would look for the address in the memory layout of the executable, which would access the filesystem and possibly causing a crash.
[^freehostinglimits]: Limits are arbitrary, cpu time is less than a second, memory is less than 128M, outbound connections are blocked.
[^cpanelssh]: with a little bit of patience you can also run a full ssh instance over an environment bootstrapped around your cpanel account space, _without_ having access to the cpanel builtin SSH which tends to be disabled by hosting providers.
[^openshift]: openshift went from a 1 year free tier to 3 months to 1 month, starting to require phone authentication, I can guarantee I was not the only one abusing their services.
[^herokucontainers]: Heroku free tier containers are quite generous in resources, they provide 4c/8t (virtual) cpus, plenty of ram and large storage (which however is not persistent and discarded on dyno shutdown).
[^saddrone]: They adde muc strictier registration rules, after a couple of bans, I might have contributed to it.
