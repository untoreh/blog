# Chronicles of a cryptonote dropper

How do you start this article? Like, one day I wake up and think you know what would be _rad_? If I could mine cryptocurrencies while doing nothing, (Isn't that the point!?). So I have a few spare virtual servers...I'll just install the mining software and BOOM! eazy money! 8)...too soon.

And here come the servers suspensions..._suspicious activities_, _high load_, _server impacting_ . Dangit.
The solution is clear ~stop wasting resources you fool and go back doing something useful!~
