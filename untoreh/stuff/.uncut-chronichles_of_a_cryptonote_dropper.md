How do you start this article? Like, one day I wake up and think you know what would be _rad_? If I could mine cryptocurrencies while doing nothing, (isn't that the point!?). So I have a few spare virtual servers...I'll just install the mining software and **BOOM!** eazy money! 8)...too soon.

Here come the servers suspensions..._suspicious activities_, _high load_, _server impacting_ . Dangit.
The solution is clear ~stop wasting resources and go back doing something useful!~
